# FSM Configuration Reference

## Configuration Resolution

Entry config search order:

1. `-s <path-or-name>` — file, directory containing `scenario.toml`, or a name
   resolved as `scenario/<name>/scenario.toml` under the configured roots;
2. `scenario/main/scenario.toml` under `-config-dir <root>`;
3. the same under `$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/vif` (normally
   `~/.config/vif`);
4. the same under each corresponding root in `$XDG_CONFIG_DIRS`;
5. embedded default (`internal/asset/scenario/`; forced with `-d`).

`-d` is mutually exclusive with both `-s` and `-f`; by itself it selects the
embedded scenario and content corpus. For the runtime design behind this reference, see
[`doc/fsm-and-configuration.md`](fsm-and-configuration.md). The complete
cross-resource order and migration policy are in
[`doc/filesystem-layout.md`](filesystem-layout.md).

The embedded main campaign is the only shipped source of `main`; `-s main`
falls back to it. A `scenario/main/` directory is an optional user override.

Region `file` references resolve relative to the entry config's directory and
cannot escape it (`..` is rejected). Installed layout:

```text
~/.config/vif/
├── scenario/
│   ├── main/  # optional override
│   │   ├── scenario.toml
│   │   ├── main.toml
│   │   ├── quasar.toml
│   │   ├── storm.toml
│   │   ├── monitor.toml
│   │   └── tower.toml
│   ├── blank/
│   │   └── scenario.toml
│   └── td/
│       └── scenario.toml
└── input/
    └── keymap.toml
```

`vif -check [-g <name-or-path>]` validates resolved FSM, keymap, audio, and
content config and exits; all state-level FSM errors are reported in one pass.
`vif -schema` prints the machine schema (events, guards, actions) as JSON.

## Root Config (`scenario.toml`)

```toml
description = "A short description for scenario selection."

[systems]
disabled_systems = ["system_name", ...] # Disabled at FSM init

[regions.region_name]
initial = "StateName"               # Initial state (omit for dynamic regions)
file = "file.toml"                  # External state definitions
background = true                   # Exclude region from telemetry overlay
enabled_systems = ["system_name"]   # Enable on region spawn/resume
disabled_systems = ["system_name"]  # Disable on region spawn/resume
```

---

## State Definition

```toml
[states.StateName]
parent = "ParentState"              # Default: "Root"
on_enter = [...]                    # Actions on state entry
on_update = [...]                   # Actions every tick while active
on_exit = [...]                     # Actions on state exit
transitions = [...]                 # Transition rules
```

---

## Transitions

```toml
{ trigger = "EventName", target = "TargetState" }
{ trigger = "EventName", target = "TargetState", guard = "GuardName", guard_args = { ... } }
{ trigger = "Tick", target = "TargetState", guard = "StateTimeExceeds", guard_args = { ms = 1000 } }
```

`Tick` — evaluated every game tick; use with guard to control timing.

### Variable Capture from Payloads

Extract event payload fields into FSM variables when a transition matches:

```toml
{ trigger = "EventSpeciesCreated", target = "NextState",
  guard = "PayloadIntCompare", guard_args = { field = "species", op = "eq", value = 5 },
  capture_vars = { entity = "pylon_entity" } }
```

`species` uses the `component.SpeciesType` values: drain `1`, swarm `2`,
quasar `3`, storm `4`, pylon `5`, snake `6`, eye `7`, tower `8`, and kraken `9`.

`capture_vars` maps payload field names to FSM variable names. Fields resolve by `toml` struct tag first, then Go field name. Captured values are set **before** the target state's `on_enter` executes.

Supported field kinds: all signed and unsigned integer widths (including
`core.Entity`), `float32`, `float64`, and `bool` (`true` = 1, `false` = 0).

Combine with guards and payload injection:

```toml
# Capture a pylon from the shared species response, then inject it into a follow-up request
{ trigger = "EventSpeciesCreated", target = "AttachGateway",
  guard = "PayloadIntCompare", guard_args = { field = "species", op = "eq", value = 5 },
  capture_vars = { entity = "anchor_id" } }
# In AttachGateway on_enter:
{ action = "EmitEvent", event = "EventGatewaySpawnRequest", payload = { anchor_entity = 0 }, payload_vars = { anchor_entity = "anchor_id" } }
```

### Transition Actions

Actions attached to a transition execute between the exit and enter phases:

```toml
{ trigger = "EventGoldCompleted", target = "NextWave", actions = [
    { action = "IncrementVar", payload = { name = "wave" } },
] }
```

Execution order on a matching transition:
`capture_vars` → `on_exit` (leaf → LCA) → transition `actions` → `on_enter` (LCA → target leaf).

A transition targeting the currently active state executes its actions only
(no exit/enter, no time reset).

### Internal Transitions

`internal = true` consumes the trigger without changing state. No `target`,
no `on_exit`/`on_enter`, `TimeInState` unaffected. Declared on a composite
state, it fires while **any** descendant is active — the pattern for counting
events without leaving the current state:

```toml
[states.TowerCycle]
transitions = [
    { trigger = "EventSpeciesKilled", internal = true,
      guard = "PayloadIntCompare", guard_args = { field = "species", op = "eq", value = 5 }, actions = [
        { action = "IncrementVar", payload = { name = "pylons_dead" } },
    ] },
]
```

An internal transition consumes the event/tick and stops bubbling; place it
below higher-priority transitions of the same trigger. An internal `Tick`
transition with a passing guard executes every tick and shadows all outer
`Tick` transitions — equivalent to a guarded `on_update`.

---

## Lifecycle Hooks

`on_enter` — root → leaf on entry. `on_exit` — leaf → root on exit.
`on_update` — every tick for **every state on the active path**, root → leaf.

### Delayed Actions

`delay_ms` counts down in region time and survives transitions while the
owning state remains on the active path. Delayed actions are cleared when
their owning state exits. Transition actions with `delay_ms` are owned by the
target state; internal-transition actions by the active leaf. Captures store a
deterministic compiled action identity, so delayed entry, update, and transition
actions resume the same work after join or correction.

### Reconciled Local Lifecycle

A live snapshot install moves the Shared FSM directly to the authority's state.
It does not replay normal entry/exit work because the captured Shared world
already contains those results. For a persistent instance-local hold, mark the
immediate `ClassLocal` event actions on the common parent that owns its lifetime:

```toml
[states.EncounterHold]
parent = "Root"
on_enter = [
  { action = "EmitEvent", event = "EventDrainPause", reconcile = true },
]
on_exit = [
  { action = "EmitEvent", event = "EventDrainResume", reconcile = true },
]

[states.EncounterSetup]
parent = "EncounterHold"
```

Marked exits run leaf-to-root with old variables, then marked entries run
root-to-leaf with imported variables. A changed `payload_vars` value also moves
the scope by releasing the old hold before acquiring the new one. The staging
world emits no reconciliation events.

`reconcile = true` is valid only on an unguarded, non-delayed `EmitEvent` in
`on_enter`/`on_exit`, and its event must be `ClassLocal`. Never mark rewards,
spawns, sounds, strobes, or other one-shot work. Acquisition and release belong
on one common parent so normal transitions and whole-region retirement use the
same boundary.

---

## Actions

### Event Emission

```toml
{ action = "EmitEvent", event = "EventName" }
{ action = "EmitEvent", event = "EventName", payload = { field = value, ... } }
{ action = "EmitEvent", event = "EventName", payload = { field = 0 }, payload_vars = { field = "var_name" } }
```

`payload_vars` — injects FSM variable value into payload field at runtime.

### Region Control

```toml
{ action = "SpawnRegion", region = "region_name", initial_state = "StateName" }
{ action = "TerminateRegion", region = "region_name" }
{ action = "PauseRegion", region = "region_name" }
{ action = "ResumeRegion", region = "region_name" }
```

### Variables

```toml
{ action = "SetVar", payload = { name = "var_name", value = 0 } }
{ action = "IncrementVar", payload = { name = "var_name", delta = 1 } }
{ action = "DecrementVar", payload = { name = "var_name", delta = 1 } }
```

`delta` defaults to 1 if omitted.

### Arithmetic Actions

```toml
{ action = "MultiplyVar", payload = { name = "var_name", delta = 2 } }
{ action = "DivideVar", payload = { name = "var_name", delta = 2 } }
{ action = "ModuloVar", payload = { name = "var_name", delta = 10 } }
{ action = "ClampVar", payload = { name = "var_name", min = 0, max = 100 } }
{ action = "CopyVar", payload = { name = "dest_var", source_var = "src_var" } }
```

Division/modulo by zero is a no-op.

### Variable-to-Variable Operations

Use `source_var` to reference another variable's value instead of a literal:

```toml
# Add wave_bonus to score
{ action = "IncrementVar", payload = { name = "score", source_var = "wave_bonus" } }

# Set damage to base_damage * multiplier (two steps)
{ action = "CopyVar", payload = { name = "damage", source_var = "base_damage" } }
{ action = "MultiplyVar", payload = { name = "damage", source_var = "multiplier" } }
```

### Clamped Operations

Apply bounds with `min`/`max` (optional, independent):

```toml
{ action = "IncrementVar", payload = { name = "heat", delta = 10, max = 100 } }
{ action = "DecrementVar", payload = { name = "energy", delta = 5, min = 0 } }
{ action = "SetVar", payload = { name = "level", source_var = "raw_level", min = 1, max = 99 } }
```

### Config to Variable

```toml
{ action = "ConfigToVar", payload = { field = "viewport_width", name = "vw" } }
```

Reads a `ConfigResource` field value into an FSM variable at execution time. Enables
dynamic position arithmetic based on runtime dimensions. Under a shared map the
viewport fields read the map bounds, so a level laid out around them is the same on
every participant (D-14).

Available fields (same set as `ConfigIntCompare`):
`map_width`, `map_height`, `viewport_width`, `viewport_height`, `camera_x`, `camera_y`, `color_mode`

### Nested payload_vars (Dot-Path Injection)

`payload_vars` supports dot-separated paths for injecting FSM variables into
nested struct fields and slice elements. Each path segment resolves by `toml`
struct tag first, then Go field name. Numeric segments index into slices.

**Syntax:** Keys containing dots must be quoted in TOML.

```toml
# Inject variable "cx" into Rooms[0].CenterX
{ action = "EmitEvent", event = "EventMazeSpawnRequest",
  payload = { rooms = [{ width = 15, height = 11 }] },
  payload_vars = { "rooms.0.center_x" = "cx", "rooms.0.center_y" = "cy" }
}
```

**Path resolution per segment:**

- Struct field: matches `toml:"tag_name"`, falls back to Go field name
- Slice index: numeric literal (0-based), must be within pre-defined slice bounds
- Pointer: auto-dereferenced

The payload slice must be pre-populated in `payload` with the correct number of
elements. `payload_vars` overwrites individual fields; it does not append
elements. Flat keys (no dots) behave identically to the original implementation.

### System Control

```toml
{ action = "EnableSystem", payload = { system_name = "name" } }
{ action = "DisableSystem", payload = { system_name = "name" } }
```

### Status Registry Actions

```toml
{ action = "SetStatusInt", payload = { key = "status.key", value = 100 } }
{ action = "ResetStatusInt", payload = { key = "status.key" } }
```

`ResetStatusInt` sets the value to 0.

### Action Modifiers

```toml
{ action = "...", delay_ms = 500 }                    # Delay execution
{ action = "...", guard = "GuardName" }               # Conditional execution
{ action = "...", guard = "GuardName", guard_args = { ... } }
{ action = "EmitEvent", event = "EventDrainPause", reconcile = true } # Persistent local lifecycle only
```

## Cursor Lifecycle

The world spawns with no cursor. A configuration must spawn one explicitly:

```toml
{ action = "EmitEvent", event = "EventCursorSpawnRequest", payload = { center = true } }
{ action = "EmitEvent", event = "EventCursorSpawnRequest", payload = { x = 10, y = 5, slot = 1 } }
{ action = "EmitEvent", event = "EventCursorDespawnRequest", payload = { all = true } }
```

`center` overrides `x`/`y`; `auto` overrides `slot` with the lowest free index.
`EventCursorSpawned` carries `entity`, `slot`, `x`, `y`; `EventCursorSpawnFailed`
signals a full roster or a blocked map. A cursor-less configuration is legal.

Capture the entity to address that cursor in later actions:

```toml
{ trigger = "EventCursorSpawned", target = "Arm", capture_vars = { entity = "player_entity" } }
# In Arm on_enter:
{ action = "EmitEvent", event = "EventHeatSetRequest", payload = { entity = 0, value = 10 }, payload_vars = { entity = "player_entity" } }
```

Every player-scoped command payload accepts an `entity` field. Omitting it
addresses the local cursor — a migration convenience, not the target design.

---

## Player Metrics

Per-cursor state is published under `player.<slot>.<metric>`:

| Key                              | Description                |
|----------------------------------|----------------------------|
| `player.<n>.entity`              | Entity id, 0 when empty    |
| `player.<n>.control`             | 0=human, 1=bot, 2=remote   |
| `player.<n>.x`, `player.<n>.y`   | Position, -1 when empty    |
| `player.<n>.energy.current`      | Energy                     |
| `player.<n>.heat.current`        | Heat                       |
| `player.<n>.heat.overheat`       | Overheat accumulator       |
| `player.<n>.heat.at_max`         | Heat at cap                |
| `player.<n>.heat.ember`          | Ember decay active         |
| `player.<n>.shield.active`       | Shield up                  |
| `player.<n>.typing.max_streak`   | Longest correct run        |

`player.count` and `player.local` describe the roster.
`session.any_defeated` becomes true when any rostered cursor reports zero heat
and zero energy; all shipped scenarios use it for game over.
`session.all_defeated` remains available for scenarios requiring unanimous defeat.
Both derive from replicated owner reports and are safe shared-region guards.
Reports carry their production tick; a reset rejects reports from the previous attempt.

The bare keys `energy.current`, `heat.current`, `heat.overheat`, `heat.at_max`,
`heat.ember`, `shield.active`, `boost.active`, `boost.remaining`, `weapon.rod`,
`weapon.launcher`, `weapon.disruptor`, `weapon.turret`, `weapon.emitter`, `weapon.orbs`, `typing.max_streak`,
`player.x`, `player.y` mirror **the slot this instance drives**. That is what
"the player" means on a status bar or in an operator command, and it is why the
mirror follows the roster rather than slot 0: slot 0 is the coordinator's cursor,
so on every guest a slot-0 mirror named a cursor that instance does not author.

They are therefore **instance-local by construction and must not be a guard key
in a shared region** — a shared region has to take the same transition on every
instance (D-20), and a guard that names a cursor names its slot:
`player.0.energy.current`. A participant that drives no cursor — a dedicated
host — mirrors nothing and the bare keys read as reset.

Occurrence counters stay roster-wide totals: `typing.correct`, `typing.errors`,
`shield.shield_hit`, `energy.spend_count`, `energy.crossed_zero_count`,
`energy.damage_multiplier`.

## Guards

### Factory Guards (parameterized)

| Guard               | Args                   | Description                          |
|---------------------|------------------------|--------------------------------------|
| `StateTimeExceeds`  | `ms`                   | Time in current state ≥ ms           |
| `StatusBoolEquals`  | `key`, `value`         | Status registry bool equals value    |
| `StatusIntCompare`  | `key`, `op`, `value`   | Status registry int comparison       |
| `RegionExists`      | `region`               | Region is currently active           |
| `VarEquals`         | `var`, `value`         | FSM variable equals value            |
| `VarCompare`        | `var`, `op`, `value`   | FSM variable comparison              |
| `ConfigIntCompare`  | `field`, `op`, `value` | ConfigResource int field comparison  |
| `ConfigBoolCompare` | `field`, `value`       | ConfigResource bool field comparison |
| `VarCompareVar`     | `var_a`, `op`, `var_b` | Compare two FSM variables            |

**Operators (`op`):** `eq`, `neq`, `gt`, `gte`, `lt`, `lte`

### Static Guards

| Guard                 | Description         |
|-----------------------|---------------------|
| `AlwaysTrue`          | Always passes       |
| `StateTimeExceeds2s`  | Time in state > 2s  |
| `StateTimeExceeds10s` | Time in state > 10s |

---

## Compound Guards

Combine multiple guards with logical operators.

### And (all must pass)

```toml
{ trigger = "Tick", target = "TargetState", guard = "And", guard_args = { guards = [
    { name = "StatusIntCompare", args = { key = "player.0.heat.current", op = "eq", value = 0 } },
    { name = "StatusIntCompare", args = { key = "player.0.energy.current", op = "eq", value = 0 } }
]}}
```

### Or (at least one must pass)

```toml
{ trigger = "Tick", target = "Critical", guard = "Or", guard_args = { guards = [
    { name = "StatusIntCompare", args = { key = "health", op = "lte", value = 10 } },
    { name = "VarEquals", args = { var = "shield_broken", value = 1 } }
]}}
```

### Not (negates one guard)

```toml
{ trigger = "Tick", target = "Seek", guard = "Not", guard_args = { guard =
    { name = "StatusBoolEquals", args = { key = "boost.active", value = true } } } }
```

Compound guards support nesting:

```toml
{ trigger = "Tick", target = "Special", guard = "And", guard_args = { guards = [
    { name = "StateTimeExceeds", args = { ms = 1000 } },
    { name = "Or", args = { guards = [
        { name = "VarEquals", args = { var = "mode", value = 1 } },
        { name = "VarEquals", args = { var = "mode", value = 2 } }
    ]}}
]}}
```

Empty `guards` array evaluates to `true`.

---

## Payload Guards

Inspect event payload fields directly in guards. Fields resolve by `toml`
struct tag first, then Go field name — identical to `capture_vars` and
`payload_vars`.

### PayloadIntCompare

```toml
{ trigger = "EventSpeciesKilled", target = "BossKilled", guard = "PayloadIntCompare", guard_args = { field = "species", op = "eq", value = 5 } }
```

### PayloadBoolEquals

```toml
{ trigger = "EventGamePauseChanged", target = "Paused", guard = "PayloadBoolEquals", guard_args = { field = "paused", value = true } }
```

### PayloadStringEquals

```toml
{ trigger = "EventNetworkError", target = "ConnectionFailed", guard = "PayloadStringEquals", guard_args = { field = "error", value = "connection failed" } }
```

### PayloadExists

```toml
{ trigger = "EventGoldCompleted", target = "HasData", guard = "PayloadExists" }
```

Payload guards return `false` if:

- No payload present (Tick transitions, nil payload)
- Field does not exist
- Field type mismatch

Combine with compound guards:

```toml
{ trigger = "EventMetaSystemCommandRequest", target = "EnableMotion", guard = "And", guard_args = { guards = [
    { name = "PayloadStringEquals", args = { field = "system_name", value = "motion" } },
    { name = "PayloadBoolEquals", args = { field = "enabled", value = true } }
]}}
```

---

## Variables

Variables are **machine-global**: shared across all regions and states.
They persist across transitions and region spawn/terminate; cleared only on
FSM init/reset. Regions that respawn must explicitly re-zero their counters
in the setup state.

`delta` defaults to 1 for `IncrementVar`, `DecrementVar`, `MultiplyVar`,
`DivideVar`. `ModuloVar` with omitted or zero delta is a no-op.

---

## Variable Payload Injection

Inject FSM variable values into event payloads:

```toml
{ action = "EmitEvent", event = "EventHeatAddRequest", payload = { delta = 0 }, payload_vars = { delta = "damage_multiplier" } }
```

Supported field kinds: all signed and unsigned integer widths, `float32`,
`float64`, and `bool`. Negative values are ignored for unsigned fields.

---

## Timing Caveat

`StateTimeExceeds` reads `TimeInState`, which is **region-scoped** and resets
on every transition in the region. On a transition declared on an ancestor
state, it measures time since the region's last transition — not time within
the ancestor's subtree. Rapid child-state cycling (e.g. spawn-retry loops)
starves ancestor-level timeouts.

---

## Config Fields

Available fields for `ConfigIntCompare`:

| Field             | Description                            |
|-------------------|----------------------------------------|
| `color_mode`      | Render mode (0=256-color, 1=TrueColor) |
| `map_width`       | Simulation bounds width                |
| `map_height`      | Simulation bounds height               |
| `viewport_width`  | Drawable width, map bounds if shared   |
| `viewport_height` | Drawable height, map bounds if shared  |
| `camera_x`        | Camera X offset                        |
| `camera_y`        | Camera Y offset                        |

Available fields for `ConfigBoolCompare`:

| Field            | Description          |
|------------------|----------------------|
| `crop_on_resize` | Resize behavior flag |

### Variable-to-Variable Guard

```toml
{ trigger = "Tick", target = "Victory", guard = "VarCompareVar", guard_args = { var_a = "kills", op = "gte", var_b = "target_kills" } }
```

---

## Game Time

`time.game_elapsed_ms` available via `StatusIntCompare` (resets each game session):

```toml
{ trigger = "Tick", target = "LateGame", guard = "StatusIntCompare", guard_args = { key = "time.game_elapsed_ms", op = "gte", value = 60000 } }
```

---

## Execution Order

1. **FSM Init** — apply `[systems].disabled_systems`, enter initial states
2. **Region Spawn** — apply region `enabled_systems`/`disabled_systems`
3. **Tick** — process delayed actions, execute `on_update` (root → leaf), evaluate transitions (leaf → root, first match wins)
4. **Transition** — `capture_vars`, `on_exit` (leaf → LCA), transition `actions`, `on_enter` (LCA → leaf)

---

## Notes

- One transition per region per tick or per event; a matching leaf transition
  shadows ancestors
- Paused regions drop events entirely (no queueing)
- `Root` lifecycle actions are rejected during loading because `Root` is shared
  by every region; put one-shot setup in a dedicated region's initial state
- Event payloads are shared compiled templates: handlers must treat them as
  immutable; `payload_vars` produces an isolated copy
- Region-control actions (`TerminateRegion` on self) are supported in
  `on_enter`/`on_exit`/transition actions; unsupported in `on_update`
