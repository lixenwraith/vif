# External Filesystem Layout

vif treats external files as user-owned overrides of an executable that
remains self-contained. Native builds discover one categorized configuration
tree and write runtime output to the platform user-state tree. Browser builds
skip host discovery and use embedded assets.

## 1. Two payloads in the repository

| Payload | Location | Reaches the user as |
|---|---|---|
| External | `wad/` | Files installed into a configuration root |
| Embedded | `internal/asset/` | Bytes compiled into the binary |

`wad/` mirrors the installed tree exactly, so installing it is a copy and
`vif -config-dir wad` plays the repository checkout without installing
anything. The embedded keymap and bot graphs have no `wad/` copy: they are
installed from `internal/asset/input/keymap.toml` and `internal/asset/bot/`, so the
file the binary falls back to and the file a user edits are one source.

```text
wad/                            internal/asset/
├── scenario/   named scenarios  ├── scenario/  fallback scenario
│   ├── main/   default          ├── content/   fallback corpus
│   ├── blank/  scaffold         ├── input/     default keymap
│   └── td/     tower defence    ├── audio/     built-in sound bank
├── content/    typing corpus    ├── bot/       shipped bot graphs
└── image/      .vifimg assets   ├── vif.toml   default settings
                                 └── splash_font.go
```

The external `main` scenario and the embedded fallback are intentionally
separate. The external one is editable and extended; the embedded one is the
self-contained fallback required by native and browser binaries. They need not
contain the same optional regions.

## 2. Installed configuration tree

The user root is Go's `os.UserConfigDir` plus `vif`:
`$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/vif` (normally `~/.config/vif`) on Linux and
FreeBSD, `%AppData%\vif` on Windows, `~/Library/Application Support/vif`
on macOS. `make install-config` writes that same root. A distribution package
installs the tree under `/etc/xdg/vif`, the `XDG_CONFIG_DIRS` default, or on
FreeBSD under `/usr/local/etc/xdg/vif`; system roots exist on Unix-like targets
only.

```text
vif/
├── vif.toml     settings: flag defaults (§3)
├── scenario/    named scenarios, each rooted at scenario.toml
│   ├── main/    discovered default
│   ├── blank/   authoring scaffold
│   └── td/      tower-defence scenario
├── input/       keymap.toml
├── audio/       music.toml, sounds.toml (optional overrides)
├── content/     .txt and .toml typing corpus
├── image/       .vifimg wall assets
└── bot/         bot graphs, one <name>.toml each
```

`scenario/main/` is the automatically discovered scenario. The other directories
under `scenario/` are selected by name (`-s td`) or explicit path.
`audio/` is empty until a user or `soundlab` writes an override. `image/` is the
discovery category for `.vifimg` assets named by a `WallPatternSpawnRequest`.

## 3. Resolution policy

An individual resource flag (`-s`, `-f`, `-k`, `-config-music`, or
`-config-sounds`) is strict and always wins. `-s` first accepts an existing
`scenario.toml` path or scenario directory; a single name such as `td` then
resolves as `scenario/td/scenario.toml` through the roots below. Without an override, every
resource walks the same roots in order:

1. `-config-dir <root>`;
2. the user configuration root;
3. each root in `$XDG_CONFIG_DIRS`; unset, that is `/etc/xdg`, and on FreeBSD
   `/usr/local/etc/xdg` then `/etc/xdg`, because ports install under `/usr/local`.

The first root holding the categorized path wins, so an older user layout still
overrides a newer system installation. A resource absent from every root uses
the embedded fallback.

| Resource | Path in each root | Final fallback |
|---|---|---|
| Scenario | `scenario/main/scenario.toml` | embedded scenario |
| Keymap | `input/keymap.toml` | embedded keymap |
| Music | `audio/music.toml` | built-in patterns |
| Sounds | `audio/sounds.toml` | built-in sound bank |
| Content | `content/` | embedded tutorial corpus |
| Wall image | `image/<name>.vifimg` | none; failure is reported in the game status |
| Bot graph | `bot/<name>.toml`, or the path `-bot` names | the embedded graph of that name |

An explicit scenario directory means one whose entry is directly at
`<directory>/scenario.toml`. A named scenario is searched under
`scenario/<name>/` in root priority order. An explicit content file pins delivery to that file. For a wall
image, an existing absolute or relative path is explicit; otherwise the event's
path is a logical name below each root's `image/` directory, and it may include
nested directories but not `..`. New configurations should use a logical name or
an absolute path; the relative-path check remains for compatibility. Missing
explicit paths or names are errors; absent discovered overrides are normal.

`-d` bypasses scenario and content discovery only. Keymap and audio overrides remain
local participant preferences and retain their ordinary resolution.

A fleet node carries a partial root. `/var/db/vif/wad` holds `scenario/` and
`image/` and nothing else, mounted read-only at `/wad` in every session pod, so a
session resolves its scenario from the node and its corpus and keymap from the
binary. That is deliberate: a native guest running `-d` has to be able to join one,
and its content identity is `embedded`.

`vif.toml` at the top of a root holds what a flag would otherwise say on every run:
`[paths]` names another root (`root`, read as `-config-dir` is), the log,
journal and music directories, and the scenario, content and keymap `-s`, `-f` and `-k`
take; `[audio] buffer_ms` sets the mixer period. It is found like any resource,
from `-config-dir` down to the system roots; the first file wins whole, a key it
omits keeps the embedded default, and the `vif.toml` inside its own `root` is not
read. Every key is a default: a flag given on the command line wins, and `-d`
still takes the embedded scenario and content. A relative path is relative to the
file, `~/` is the home directory, and an unknown key is refused. `-check` names
the file it read. Music and sound overrides stay out of it, because a run that
creates no audio refuses them and a default must not break `-serve`.

## 4. Installation

```bash
make install-config                                  # into the user root
make install-config VIF_CONFIG_DIR=/path/to/stage    # into a staging root
make install DESTDIR=/pkg PREFIX=/usr SYSCONFDIR=/etc # distribution package
```

`install-config` copies `wad/` plus the embedded keymap and retains existing
files, so an update never overwrites user edits; `install-config-force` replaces
them. `install` stages a package: binary, `wad/` as a system configuration root,
licence, and documentation. See [Packaging](packaging.md).

## 5. Logs, journals, and runtime output

Native Unix builds use `$XDG_STATE_HOME` (normally `~/.local/state`) and keep
the streams separate:

| Output | Default | Override |
|---|---|---|
| Session logs, snapshots, recorder files, runtime stderr capture, profiles and traces | `$XDG_STATE_HOME/vif/log/` | `-l=DIR`, `paths.log` |
| Replay journals | `$XDG_STATE_HOME/vif/journal/` | `-j=DIR`, `paths.journal` |
| Music recordings | `$XDG_STATE_HOME/vif/music/` | `-mw=DIR`, `paths.music` |

On platforms without an XDG state root, the platform user-cache directory is
used. Only when no user location can be resolved does either stream fall back to
`./log/`. `/var/log` is never assumed.

Bare `-l`, `-j` and `-mw` enable their streams at the defaults. Because they are
Go boolean-style flags, a directory must use the equals form.

## 6. Package ownership and WASM

`internal/paths` owns platform directory discovery, names and `vif.toml`. `internal/resource`
owns composition-time resource selection. Loaders in `internal/fsm`,
`internal/input`, `internal/content`, and `internal/service` receive
already-resolved files or filesystem capabilities; they do not invent search
orders. Runtime categorized opens, including strict explicit-path handling,
cross the generic `FileService` capability contributed to the world; systems do
not open host paths directly.

`internal/asset` owns every embedded group and is the only package with an
`embed` directive for shipped data. In an audio-capable build, `pkg/audio`
carries no specs of its own: `internal/parameter.BuiltinSounds` parses the
embedded bank and hands it to the engine as `AudioConfig.BaseSounds`, which is
what keeps `pkg/` free of `internal/` imports. Audio-free and browser builds omit
that loader and the audio engine.

A `js/wasm` build performs no host-directory discovery, so it remains playable
from the embedded scenario, content, and keymap. Page launch arguments do not make
external URLs into files; downloadable `wad/` content needs an HTTP-backed
resource provider. See [Build profiles and platform boundaries](multi-platform.md).
