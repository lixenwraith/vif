# vif Architecture Overview

vif is a Go terminal game built around a custom entity-component-system
(ECS), an event-settled fixed-step scheduler, a TOML-configured hierarchical
state machine, a layered terminal compositor, and a procedural audio engine.
The game combines vi-style cursor and text operations with real-time combat,
adaptive navigation, and evolving species parameters.

This document is the high-level entry point. It replaces the older assumptions
that the repository is standard-library-only and that all simulation math is
strictly deterministic. The current repository imports the separately
maintained `terminal`, `toml`, `color`, and `log` modules. Simulation math is
`float64`, with integer values reserved for discrete grid-cell topology; the
driven runtime's reproducibility is deliberately narrower than a
cross-platform lockstep guarantee.

## 1. System context

```mermaid

    Player["Player"] --> App["vif application"]
    Author["Scenario or content author"] --> App
    App --> Terminal["Terminal or browser terminal"]
    App --> Audio["System audio process or sink"]
    App --> Files["TOML, text, logs, and optional WAV files"]
```

The application owns gameplay and orchestration. It delegates terminal
protocol details to `github.com/lixenwraith/terminal`, TOML parsing to
`github.com/lixenwraith/toml`, RGB operations to
`github.com/lixenwraith/color`, and asynchronous log transport to
`github.com/lixenwraith/log`.

## 2. Application containers

```mermaid

    Entry["cmd/vif: flags and diagnostics"] --> App["internal/app: composition root"]
    App --> Converge["internal/converge: authority protocol"]
    App --> Journal["internal/journal: deterministic run streams"]
    App --> Runtime["World, scheduler, FSM, input router"]
    App --> IO["Service hub: files, terminal, content, audio, network"]
    Runtime --> Presentation["Render orchestrator and renderers"]
    Runtime --> Libraries["audio, navigation, vmath, physics, genetics"]
```

The main architectural planes are:

| Plane | Owners | Responsibility |
|---|---|---|
| Composition | `cmd/vif`, `internal/app`, `internal/manifest` | Resolve options, construct services/resources/systems/renderers, load the FSM, start and stop the process. |
| Simulation data | `internal/engine`, `internal/component`, `internal/core` | Entity identities, typed sparse-set component stores, singleton resources, spatial indexing, and shared time/state. |
| Simulation behavior | `internal/system`, `internal/fsm`, `internal/event` | Per-tick mechanics, event reactions, encounter control, reset, and system enablement. |
| Interaction | `internal/input`, `internal/mode` | Parse terminal events into semantic intents and apply them under the world lock. |
| Authority and convergence | `internal/converge` | Hold the session's authority term and run its succession, publish the correction cadence, answer the selective manifest exchange, install what arrives, and keep the links a handoff needs. It reads and writes the live world only through the seam the composition root supplies. |
| Deterministic run streams | `internal/journal` | Attach recording sinks, capture/load journals, order replay records, generate seeded fuzz input, and execute authored tick scripts through App-independent target contracts. |
| Presentation | `internal/render`, `internal/render/renderer`, `internal/parameter/visual` | Snapshot frame context, layer cells, apply masks/effects, and flush to the terminal. |
| I/O boundaries | `internal/service`, `internal/content`, `internal/network`, external modules | Categorized file access, terminal polling, corpus loading, audio device/process management, and framed network sessions. |
| Reusable algorithms | `pkg/*` | Audio, float64 math/physics, navigation, maze generation, evolution, and terminal-image conversion. |

See [Package map](package-map.md) for the medium-level dependency view.

## 3. Architectural control flow

`app.Mode` selects one of five application shapes before composition:

| Shape | I/O and presentation | Clock/owner |
|---|---|---|
| `ModePlay` | files, terminal, content, audio, and optional startup host/join networking; live input and geometry | pause/rate-aware clock; scheduler and event goroutines |
| `ModeHeadless` | files and content; caller supplies geometry and events; authored scripts may add startup host/join networking | manual clock advanced by a harness or `journal.ScriptDriver` |
| `ModeReplay` | files, terminal, content, audio; recorded input and geometry | manual clock advanced by `journal.ReplayDriver` |
| `ModeScript` | files, terminal, content, audio, and the same optional host/join networking as a headless script; scripted input and geometry | manual clock advanced by `journal.ScriptDriver`, wall-paced |
| `ModeServer` | files, content, and network only; configured geometry, no input, no local cursor | pause/rate-aware clock; scheduler and event goroutines, as `ModePlay` |

The `Presents`, `Driven`, `OwnsGeometry`, `OwnsInput`, and `Audio` predicates
are the composition policy. A driven App spawns no scheduler/event goroutines,
so for one build its run is a pure function of seed, config, and injected event
groups.

Build capabilities refine that policy before runtime. `vif_headless` replaces the
presentation adapter and generated renderer registry with empty implementations;
`vif_noaudio` and `wasm` remove the audio service and resource while the generated
builder selects lightweight event sinks. Runtime modes remain the
simulation/lifecycle choice, while build profiles decide which host adapters can
be selected at all. The simulation
fingerprint excludes renderers and the local-only audio capability, so a dedicated
host and a full terminal guest retain one session identity. See
[Build profiles and platform boundaries](multi-platform.md).

Interactive play has four cooperating execution paths:

1. The main goroutine selects terminal events, an input ticker, and a render
   ticker. It routes input and performs terminal output.
2. The scheduler goroutine advances simulation at a nominal 50 ms fixed step,
   gated by frame readiness.
3. The event goroutine settles queued events between simulation ticks and
   remains active while the game is paused.
4. Service-owned goroutines poll the terminal, mix audio, or, when `-host` or
   `-join` is selected, perform network I/O.

```mermaid
flowchart TD
    Input["Terminal event or input timer"] --> Intent["Input machine and mode router"]
    Intent --> Queue["MPSC game-event queue"]
    Queue --> Settle["FSM first, then registered handlers"]
    Settle --> World["Locked ECS world"]
    World --> Systems["Priority-ordered system update"]
    World --> Render["Priority-ordered render pass"]
    Render --> Flush["Terminal flush outside world lock"]
```

Queued events are not simply processed once per frame. The scheduler performs
bounded settling passes before the FSM update and again after it. Input can
request immediate settling, and a separate event loop handles inter-tick work.
This lets pre-tick, FSM, input, and reset cascades converge before their next
dependent phase. Events emitted by systems are normally picked up by the
inter-tick loop before the next frame; the next tick's initial settling is the
fallback. An iteration cap prevents an accidental event cycle from
monopolizing a thread.

An optional replay journal copies every non-system-origin event synchronously
at queue push. It uses a dedicated JSONL sink outside diagnostic level/scope
and stamps events in a `(run, tick, settle-boundary)` lattice. A headless
recording can therefore be reinjected at the same boundaries into a fresh
manual-clock App; a live recording reconstructs player input but is not the
source class for which bit-exact world comparison is claimed.

`internal/event` owns the queue-level record/anchor schema; `internal/journal`
owns everything that turns those values into a deterministic external run:
recording lifecycle, in-memory capture, rotated-file loading, replay ordering,
the seeded soak fuzzer, and the authored `-script` format. It imports no App.
`internal/app` supplies narrow adapters and retains configuration identity,
session startup, terminal playback, and process lifetime.

The exact lifecycle and synchronization rules are in
[Runtime and concurrency](runtime.md).

## 4. State ownership and concurrency model

The central invariant is deliberately simple: mutable ECS state has one lock.
The world's `updateMutex` serializes entity/component/position access from the
tick, event, input, reset, and render paths. Component stores and the spatial
grid therefore carry no inner locks.

Exceptions are explicit:

- status metrics and selected context flags use atomics;
- `GameState` owns a small lock for its APM history;
- target groups use their own read/write lock;
- the audio mixer owns its mutable sequencer/voice state on one goroutine and
  accepts commands over a bounded channel;
- service transports publish into bounded channels and never mutate the world
  from an I/O goroutine.

Diagnostics observe this model rather than participating in it. Status metrics
are per-value atomics; the periodic snapshot and the flight-recorder sample
both run after the world lock is released, so asynchronous logging can never
extend a critical section. See [Logging and diagnostics](logging-and-diagnostics.md).

Terminal output and other potentially blocking I/O happen outside the world
lock. Code reachable from `mode.Router.Handle` must not acquire that lock again,
because it is already held by the application and is non-reentrant.

Reset also has an explicit ownership split. Simulation entities/resources/FSM
state are rebuilt. Operator-owned free-mouse/auto-fire preferences, time scale,
and telemetry HUD/pins survive plain `:new`; `:new!` purges them. Replay comparison
drops that session record plus the exact observer-only keys in
`internal/snapshot/surface.go` rather than treating whole metric groups as noise.

## 5. Data-oriented ECS

Entities are 64-bit integer identifiers. Most components live in generated,
type-specific sparse sets with dense component and entity slices. This gives
constant-time lookup and swap-removal while preserving compact iteration.
Generated component-mask bookkeeping lets destruction skip stores that an
entity never occupied.

Position is specialized rather than being an ordinary generated store. It also
maintains a fixed-capacity spatial grid used for cell queries, wall masks,
line-of-sight, patterns, and nearby free-space searches. Large actors use a
header/member composite model: an invisible or controlling header owns motion
and lifecycle, while member entities provide visible and collidable cells.

Singleton resources hold time, map/camera configuration, the bounded cursor
roster and local-player selection, targets, event queue, route graphs, adaptive
route populations, the genetic registry, transient effects, telemetry, and
capabilities contributed by services. The cursors themselves are ordinary ECS
entities created and removed by `CursorSystem`; each owns its energy, heat,
shield, boost, weapon, ping, and combat components. A roster slot also records
whether a human, in-simulation bot, or remote peer controls that cursor. The
mode router and camera follow the selected local slot, while gameplay systems
can iterate or address every cursor through the same event-driven path.

Every entity, event and RNG stream carries a replication domain. Shared state
is identical on every instance and replicated; player state is this instance's
participant and is never replicated. Systems declare which of the two they read
and write, and which other systems they need, as `SystemDef` data in
`internal/manifest/definition.go`; a test checks each declaration against the
code, and the declared dependencies resolve into a deterministic initialization
order that is separate from the tick order `Priority()` fixes.

See [ECS and events](ecs-and-events.md) and [the domain model](domain-design.md).

## 6. Data-driven encounter control

The generic HFSM supports hierarchical states and multiple parallel regions.
Each active region has a leaf, a root-to-leaf path, elapsed state time, a pause
flag, and delayed actions. Events and tick transitions bubble from the leaf
toward the root. Transition payloads can be captured into integer variables,
and actions can inject variables into nested event payload fields.

The machine itself is generic. `internal/fsm/std` provides reusable variables,
regions, guards, status/config access, and event actions through a capability
host. `internal/manifest/fsm_bridge.go` binds those capabilities to the ECS and
adds the small amount of game-specific behavior.

Snapshot import has a side-effect-free staging form and a live reconciliation
form. The live form does not replay ordinary actions; it executes only
configuration-marked, persistent `ClassLocal` lifecycle events on state paths an
authoritative capture entered or left. Exits use old variables, entries use the
imported variables, and every release precedes every acquisition. Delayed work is
restored by a deterministic compiled-action identity rather than a queue index.

The embedded scenario runs foreground gameplay regions alongside a background
monitor. Alternate configurations include a blank authoring scaffold, an
expanded main encounter, and a tower-defense scenario.

See [HFSM and configuration](fsm-and-configuration.md) and the detailed
[authoring reference](fsm-reference.md).

## 7. Input as a semantic boundary

The external terminal emits keys, mouse reports, resize notifications, and
close/error events. `internal/input.Machine` converts them into pure-data
`Intent` values. It understands counts, operators, motions, character waits,
`g` prefixes, search/command text, overlays, and macro control. It has no ECS
dependency. A bot's graph produces the same intents, keys and mouse alike, and
reaches the world through the same router ([Bots](todo-bots.md)).

`internal/mode.Router` is the authoritative owner of game mode. Under the world
lock, it interprets intents against the current map and components, requests
movement for the local cursor, executes operators/search, publishes combat and
mode events, manages undo/command history, and schedules macro or mouse-repeat
input.

See [Input and modes](input-and-modes.md).

## 8. Rendering boundary

Renderers read ECS state but never write directly to the terminal. The
application first snapshots time, dimensions, camera, and the local cursor into
a value `RenderContext`. The orchestrator then clears a `RenderBuffer`, locks
the world, runs renderers in stable priority order, unlocks, finalizes
compositing, and flushes cells through the external terminal module.

The buffer supports foreground/background-specific blending, write masks,
dirty/touched tracking, deferred background overlays, TrueColor and palette
attributes, and masked grayscale/dim post-processing. Gameplay coordinates are
map based; `RenderContext` performs map-to-viewport and viewport-to-terminal
transforms.

See [Rendering](rendering.md).

## 9. Audio boundary

`pkg/audio` owns synthesis, pre-rendered sound caches, mixing, voices, harmony,
patterns, and a three-slot sequencer. It has no gameplay or APM concept.
`internal/system.MusicSystem` maps the game's five-second APM signal to tempo
and arrangement intensity; `AudioSystem` translates effect and mute/pause
events.

Audio output is zero-CGO but not device-native on most platforms: the engine
streams 44.1 kHz, 16-bit stereo PCM to an installed process such as `pacat`,
`pw-cat`, `aplay`, SoX `play`, or `ffplay`, or to FreeBSD OSS. Explicit `null`
and `wav:path` sinks support automation and offline capture. Missing backends
degrade to silence rather than aborting gameplay.

Audio service assembly is both mode- and build-dependent: an audio-capable build
registers it for play, replay, and presented scripts; headless, audio-free, and
browser builds do not contain the service or full audio systems. Small null systems
consume local audio events and publish the unavailable state so telemetry and
system identity remain stable. Event IDs live in the lightweight `pkg/audio/model`
package, so omitting the engine does not change protocol types. Journal anchors do
not carry the original mute state, so terminal playback starts audio unmuted.

See [Audio](audio.md).

## 10. Navigation, physics, adaptation, and evolution

Navigation uses aspect-weighted, eight-direction Dijkstra flow fields with
corner-cut prevention. Target groups share cached fields, while multi-cell
actors can use footprint-aware passability. Gateways may request multiple
distinct, penalized shortest-path corridors, each with a constrained flow
field.

Route adaptation is described in code as EXP3, but its current update is more
precisely a multiplicative-weights/Hedge-style learner: it applies exponential
updates to per-route mean fitness without importance weighting, then selects
with proportional exploitation plus a 10% uniform scout rate. This distinction
matters when reasoning about convergence.

The generic genetic library offers both classic generational and streaming
steady-state engines. The game adapter currently evolves eye parameters,
tracking closest approach and successful self-destruct damage as fitness. The
adapter uses an in-memory registry: archives survive an in-process `:new`, but
no persistence store is attached for process-lifetime saves. Multiplayer
captures use the separate exact-continuation contract, carrying each streaming
engine's PCG position, proposal/pending work and IDs together with the registry's
scout stream and the adapter's live fitness accumulators.

Gameplay motion uses cell-centered `float64` positions, velocities, and
accelerations. Integer `Point`/`Area` values represent discrete cells, while
floor-based conversion maps precise positions—including negative
coordinates—back to the grid. `pkg/vmath` also provides float lookup-table
trigonometry/decay, vectors, shapes, arcs, traversal, and seeded randomness;
`pkg/vmath/physics` owns the float kinetic container and 2D/3D mechanics. No
parallel fixed-point API remains. Floating-point state and live play's
concurrent scheduling prevent treating the engine as a cross-platform
bitwise-deterministic simulation.

See [AI, navigation, physics, and evolution](ai-physics-and-evolution.md).

## 11. Externalized module boundaries

Several packages that older documentation treated as in-repository utilities
are now independent modules.

| Module | Boundary owned outside this repository |
|---|---|
| `github.com/lixenwraith/terminal` | Raw/alternate-screen lifecycle, terminal event decoding, color-mode detection, cells, mouse modes, syncing, and flushing. |
| `github.com/lixenwraith/toml` | Parsing, reflection-based decoding, and encoding used by scenarios, content, keymaps, audio specs, commands, and optional genetic persistence. |
| `github.com/lixenwraith/color` | RGB values, interpolation, blend operations, grayscale, and palette-related color manipulation. |
| `github.com/lixenwraith/log` | Buffered asynchronous structured-log sink, rotation, retention, and transport below `internal/vlog`. |

`golang.org/x/sys` and `golang.org/x/term` are indirect dependencies of this
module graph. vif has no application CGO requirement, although external
audio executables or an OSS device are runtime dependencies when sound is
enabled.

## 12. Deployment shapes and current limitations

The primary build targets Linux and FreeBSD terminals. On those builds the same
composition root supports interactive play, deterministic harnesses and authored
headless scripts, and terminal journal playback. `make headless` additionally
removes terminal presentation and audio code from the dedicated artifact while
retaining TCP sessions. A headless script has no terminal or audio, but may attach
the TCP service with `-host`/`-join`.

A WASM build runs inside the bundled xterm.js page, uses embedded
FSM/content/keymap assets without host-directory discovery, and omits audio and
logging. It cannot open a socket, so it joins a session over the same-origin route
`wss://<site>/vif/ws/<session>`: the page's own WebSocket wrapped as a `net.Conn`,
carrying the protocol unchanged through the allocator to the session's game port. `-host`
and `-serve` are still rejected, because a browser can bind nothing. The page can
supply ordinary arguments through `Go.argv`, but
external `wad/` content needs an HTTP-backed resource provider rather than a file
argument. The Makefile also contains an explicitly experimental Windows
cross-build. The exact profile and browser extension strategy are in
[Build profiles and platform boundaries](multi-platform.md).

A trusted-peer TCP game of up to `parameter.MaxPlayers` participants is exposed
through `-host`, `-join`, `-serve` and `-players`. The join handshake resolves the
host anchor before the joining world is constructed, the roster every instance
builds from arrives with the start gate, a server's scheduler stays at tick zero
until its lobby's first guest while an interactive host plays from its first tick,
and the manifest-registered `NetworkSystem` drains framed input only at
the simulation's poll boundary. Trusted-peer is a statement about authentication
and nothing else: a dial is budgeted per address, the handshake is bounded and off
the accept path, and every buffer an arriving frame can reach is capped, but
nothing proves who the peer is. The artifact barrier exchanges crossings without
a synchronous per-tick round trip, and because every artifact names the absolute
tick it applies at, the authority commits each one and relays it, so a participant
reaches instances its producer never linked to. A participant stamps its own
crossings with the lead its own link asks for, and every instance applies each at
the tick the authority committed it to; the D-18 prediction is what makes local
input feel local. See [Multiplayer](multi-player.md) §3.5.

A participant may also arrive at any tick. `:host <addr>` opens a run that is
already playing; the joiner receives the shared world as a chunked capture (D-19),
resolves it into a staging world, swaps at a tick boundary, and simulates the ticks
the transfer cost so it stands where the session does. It is admitted as a peer
*before* that world is read for it, so the crossings produced during the transfer
reach it rather than falling into the gap (D-22). Reconnect is the same path a
second time. Cost is a function of world size, not of session length.

The host is the authority and a guest is a predictor (D-23). The host publishes a
versioned hash manifest on an adaptive per-link cadence. Equal roots are hash-only;
mismatches descend to independently verified pages, with compressed whole
keyframes as the bounded fallback. A guest resolves a capture in a reusable staging
world and commits it between ticks; where prediction differs, authority wins and
the correction magnitude is telemetry rather than failure. Snapshot schema 5 also
reconciles explicitly marked persistent local FSM effects that the Shared capture
cannot carry, and carries one applied crossing fence per participant so a
correction cannot undo an action it simply had not received.

Cadence responds to round-trip time, variation, delivered bytes, saturation, and
correction demand, while a fixed whole-world convergence floor prevents adaptation
from weakening recovery.

Losing the authority is answered by the session's `-authority` policy. With
`migrate` the roster's lowest surviving identity — the first guest admitted —
takes the next term, computed from the succession chain so no vote is needed and
no two instances can claim it. With `host`, which is the default for `-serve`, the
term never moves and every survivor continues alone. In a migrate session every
participant binds a port of its own and the chain carries the addresses, so
migration moves the session and not only its authorship; see
[Multiplayer](multi-player.md) §5.3.

Remaining limitations include unauthenticated plaintext native links, no browser
transport, and no merge for explicit minority forks. Remote
crossing fences record the highest applied sequence rather than a contiguous
prefix, a bounded trade-off documented in the fleet plan. The domain boundary,
event classification, wire
protocol, their enforcing tests, and an analysis of what the model does not yet
cover are in rules D-1..D-24 and §7 of [the domain model](domain-design.md). The
incident this protocol was chosen from, and the options it was chosen against, are
in [Multiplayer](multi-player.md) §10.
