# Distribution Packaging

Steps to publish vif through a distribution repository, and the
conventions a change must not break while that work is in progress. Sections 2
onward are checklists to chip away at; section 1 applies to every commit now.

## 1. Shared guidelines

These hold regardless of which repository is targeted first.

- **One external payload.** Everything a user may edit lives in `wad/`, laid
  out exactly as it installs. Everything compiled in lives in `internal/asset`.
  A new data file goes in one of those two, never beside the code that reads it.
- **No working-directory discovery.** A packaged binary must behave the same
  from any `cwd`. Resolution is `-flag` → `-config-dir` → user root → checkout
  `wad/` beside a `bin/` binary → system roots → embedded, and nothing else.
  Never reintroduce a `./config` probe.
- **Honour the environment.** `DESTDIR`, `PREFIX`, `SYSCONFDIR`. No
  target may write outside `DESTDIR`, and none may require network access.
- **The Makefile runs under GNU make and FreeBSD make.** `!=` rather than
  `$(shell)`, no conditionals, functions or order-only prerequisites, and
  recipes use only options BSD tools share: `install -d` then `install -m`, never
  `install -D`; `$(MAKE) -s`, never a GNU long option.
- **The build is reproducible and offline.** `-trimpath`, no `go generate` at
  package time (generated files are committed), no CGO. Vendoring or a module
  cache is the packager's choice, not the Makefile's. The manual `doc/vif.6` and
  the bash, zsh and fish completion in `deploy/package/` are such files: they
  render the `-h` table, `TestGeneratedFilesAreTheHelpTable` fails when a flag
  outruns them, and `VIF_WRITE_GENERATED=1` on that test rewrites them.
- **Version comes from the source, never from flags.** `git archive` expands
  `internal/asset/version.txt` to the tag and commit (`export-subst`, which
  GitHub's archives honour too), and a checkout build reads Go's VCS stamp, so
  `vif -version` names the tag without an ldflags contract. Only a Go module
  proxy zip carries neither and reports `(devel)`.
- **Runtime state is XDG.** Logs and journals under `$XDG_STATE_HOME`; nothing
  in `/var`, nothing beside the binary.
- **Licence stays declarable.** BSD-3-Clause, one `LICENSE` at the root. Any
  vendored or redistributed content (typing corpus, images, sound specs) must
  be licence-checked before it enters `wad/`.

## 2. Release surface

`.github/workflows/release.yml` builds one set of archives: Linux amd64 client and
headless server, FreeBSD amd64 client, an experimental and untested Windows amd64
zip, the browser bundle, the wad, and `SHA256SUMS`. Each unpacks into one
directory named for it, owned by root, so extracting one as root neither scatters
files nor hands them to the builder's uid.

- **Nightly** (daily or on dispatch) is never a release. It replaces the assets
  of the `nightly` prerelease, titled and described as a development build, and
  pushes the `vif_headless` image to GHCR as `nightly` and `sha-<commit>`.
- **A `vX.Y.Z-suffix` tag** (`v0.1.0-rc.1`) drafts a GitHub pre-release whose
  notes open by saying it is not a final release.
- **A plain `vX.Y.Z` tag** drafts the final release. None has been pushed.

A tag adds `vif-X.Y.Z.tar.gz`, a `git archive` of the tag and the byte-stable
source archive a distribution hashes. It pushes no image, moves nothing, and
publishes nothing until a person publishes the draft; it fails if the committed
generated files are stale, so the binaries are what the source archive builds.

`vif-*-wad.tar.gz` is `make wad-archive`, which is `install-config` into
one file: it unpacks as `vif/`, the config root, into the directory that holds
one (`~/.config`, `/usr/local/etc`, `%AppData%`), so a downloaded binary reaches
the installed scenarios and corpus rather than only the embedded scenario. The
Makefile owns its contents so a release and a source install cannot drift.

Downloads are at the repository's
[`nightly` release](https://github.com/lixenwraith/vif/releases/tag/nightly);
the image is `ghcr.io/lixenwraith/vif:nightly` or `sha-<commit>`. Content a
client fetches for itself, rather than one a person downloads and extracts, still
needs its trust, origin and cache policy decided.

## 3. Gaps to close before a first submission

`make install` stages everything a package review expects: the binary, the system
config root, the licence, `man6/vif.6`, a `Terminal=true` desktop entry with
scalable and symbolic icons, and bash, zsh and fish completion. What remains is a
stable tagged release: tag a verified nightly commit `v0.1.0` and publish the
draft §2 creates.

## 4. Arch (AUR)

Target `vif` (release) with `vif-git` optional.

1. `depends=()` — the binary is static Go with no runtime library dependency.
   `makedepends=('go')`. `optdepends` for the audio backends the engine probes
   (`pulseaudio`/`pipewire-pulse` for `pacat`, `alsa-utils` for `aplay`).
2. `build()` uses the repository's flags plus Arch's hardening:
   `go build -trimpath -buildmode=pie -mod=readonly -modcacherw`.
   `make release GO_LDFLAGS=` does the same with Arch's `GOFLAGS` exported: plain
   `make release` sets `-s -w`, which Arch's debug packaging wants to control.
3. `package()` runs `make install DESTDIR="$pkgdir" PREFIX=/usr SYSCONFDIR=/etc`.
   Confirm the licence lands in `/usr/share/licenses/vif/`.
4. `check()` runs `go test ./...`. `script/test.sh` binds ports and must not
   run in a build chroot.
5. Namcap the result. Expect a warning about the size of `/etc/vif`;
   a config tree that large is intentional and is the answer to it.
6. Submit to `ssh://aur@aur.archlinux.org/vif.git` with `.SRCINFO`
   regenerated by `makepkg --printsrcinfo`.

## 5. FreeBSD ports

Target `games/vif`. FreeBSD is a first-class runtime target: the OSS
audio backend exists for it.

1. `USES=go:modules`, `GO_MODULE=github.com/lixenwraith/vif`,
   `GO_TARGET=./cmd/vif`.
2. Ports staging sets `DESTDIR` and `PREFIX`; `SYSCONFDIR` defaults to
   `$(PREFIX)/etc`. The system root is `/usr/local/etc/vif`, which every Unix
   binary searches, so no `pkg-message` is needed.
3. Every installed file needs a `pkg-plist` entry; generate it from
   `make install DESTDIR=$(mktemp -d)` output rather than by hand.
4. `LICENSE=BSD3CLAUSE` with `LICENSE_FILE=${WRKSRC}/LICENSE`.

## 6. Debian and Ubuntu

Lowest priority: Go game packages move slowly through NEW.

1. `debian/rules` with `dh $@`; override `dh_auto_install` to call
   `make install DESTDIR=debian/vif PREFIX=/usr SYSCONFDIR=/etc`.
2. Debian prefers vendored dependencies or packaged Go modules. The four
   `lixenwraith/*` modules are not in Debian, so vendoring is the realistic
   route; commit a `vendor/` only on the packaging branch.
3. `debian/copyright` in DEP-5 form must enumerate the corpus files in
   `wad/content/` separately if any is third-party source text.
4. Lintian may flag the size of the config tree in `/etc/vif`; the override
   goes in `debian/vif.lintian-overrides`.

## 7. Verifying a staged install

```bash
make release
make install DESTDIR=/tmp/stage PREFIX=/usr SYSCONFDIR=/etc
XDG_CONFIG_HOME=/nonexistent VIF_SYSTEM_ROOTS=/tmp/stage/etc/vif \
  /tmp/stage/usr/bin/vif -check
```

Every line must report a path under the staged root, not `embedded default`.
That is the whole packaging contract in one command.
