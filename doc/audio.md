# Audio Architecture

vif includes a pure-Go synthesis, effects, mixing, and music-sequencing
engine. It streams raw PCM to an external host process/device; there is no CGO
audio dependency. Game policy is layered over the reusable `pkg/audio` engine
by the audio service and the `AudioSystem`/`MusicSystem` pair.

## 1. Layered design

```mermaid
flowchart TD
    Events["game events and APM"] --> Systems["AudioSystem and MusicSystem"]
    Systems --> Engine["pkg/audio AudioEngine"]
    Engine --> Mixer["single mixer goroutine"]
    Mixer --> PCM["44.1 kHz stereo PCM"]
    PCM --> Backend["host process, OSS, WAV, or null"]
```

| Layer | Responsibility |
|---|---|
| `internal/service.AudioService` | Configure, construct, start/stop, and contribute the engine capability. |
| `internal/system.AudioSystem` | Translate game sound/mute/pause events and publish audio telemetry. |
| `internal/system.MusicSystem` | Map APM and explicit music events to tempo, intensity, harmony, and patterns. |
| `pkg/audio.AudioEngine` | Public thread-safe control surface, sound/pattern registries, backend lifecycle/failover. |
| `pkg/audio.Mixer` | Own all live voices/sequencer state and render output buffers. |
| Backend | Consume signed 16-bit little-endian stereo frames. |

`pkg/audio` carries no ECS or APM concept. The app injects effect volumes and
shapes, and `MusicSystem` interprets the game's five-second APM signal.

Runtime mode and build capability select whether this layer exists. In a full
build, `ModePlay`, `ModeReplay` and `ModeScript` register the audio service;
`ModeHeadless` and `ModeServer` do not. `vif_noaudio`, `vif_headless`, and
`js/wasm` omit the service, engine resource, full audio systems, and `pkg/audio`
implementation. Lightweight null systems still consume local audio events and
publish audio as unavailable, preserving telemetry and system controls. Event
payloads retain compatible identifiers through the small `pkg/audio/model`
package. Replay rebuilds simulation from recorded events, including sound
requests; the journal carries no mute state, so `-mute`, `-ab` and `-mw` are the
viewer's. The viewer's pause holds the mixer, as the game's pause does, and so
does the end of the stream: its sound fades and stays faded.

## 2. Stream contract

| Property | Value |
|---|---|
| Sample rate | 44,100 Hz |
| Channels | 2 (stereo) |
| Format | Signed 16-bit little-endian PCM |
| Bytes per frame | 4 |
| Buffer duration | 50 ms; `vif.toml` `[audio] buffer_ms`, 10–200 in steps of 10 |
| Frames per buffer | 441 per 10 ms (2,205 at 50) |

Every mixer pass drains pending commands, renders music and effects into
separate floating-point buses, sidechain-ducks music under effects, applies the
pause gain ramp, limits/converts samples, and writes one PCM buffer. The output
writer is the only backend-specific part of that path.

## 3. Backend detection and failover

Automatic candidates are tried in this order:

| Priority | Backend | Host target |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | `pacat` | PulseAudio protocol, also commonly available through PipeWire compatibility. |
| 2 | `pw-cat` | Native PipeWire. |
| 3 | `aplay` | ALSA command-line playback. |
| 4 | `sox` | The SoX `play` executable. |
| 5 | `ffplay` | FFmpeg playback. |
| 6 | `oss` | `/dev/dsp`, considered only on FreeBSD. |

Detection first checks executable/device availability. Attachment starts a
candidate, writes one silent buffer, and waits through a short survival window;
bad arguments, an unavailable daemon, or an immediate broken pipe fall through
to the next candidate. A process that accepts data but routes it nowhere cannot
be detected by this probe.

The supervisor can move to an untried candidate if the active process exits.
Backend lifecycle has its own mutex because failover and shutdown can race.

`-ab <name>`, long form `-audio-backend <name>`, restricts selection to one
backend. Two explicit-only synthetic
backends are useful in automation:

- `-ab null` runs the full mixer and discards samples;
- `-ab wav:path/to/out.wav` captures the live stream into a finalized WAV file.

`-mw[=DIR]` (`-music-wav`, `paths.music`) records the music bus alone, before
ducking, to `vif-mus-<stamp>.wav` beside the logs: what plays, so a muted or
paused stretch adds nothing. It needs a running mixer; `-ab null -mw` records
on a machine with no device.

If no backend survives, the service degrades to a valid silent engine. Gameplay
continues, sound requests become no-ops with rejection telemetry, and absence
of a device is not an application-start failure.

## 4. Concurrency and command ownership

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant Caller
    participant Engine
    participant Queue
    participant Mixer
    Caller->>Engine: Play or control method
    Engine->>Queue: ordered audio command
    Mixer->>Queue: drain at buffer boundary
    Mixer->>Mixer: update sequencer and voices
    Mixer->>Mixer: render one PCM buffer
```

All controls—including playback, mute, pause, tempo, patterns, harmony, and
hot reload—share one command channel, preserving arrival order. The live
sequencer, pattern players, voices, active effects, and buses are confined to
the mixer goroutine and need no inner locks.

Commands sent before `Start` are retained in a 64-entry ordered buffer. After
startup, the mixer channel holds 256 commands. A full queue rejects the command;
play rejections are categorized as not running, silent, paused, muted, bad ID,
or queue full. Played/dropped totals and rejection categories are surfaced
through the game status registry.

Shutdown stops the mixer/backend with a bounded wait so a wedged audio process
cannot prevent restoration of the terminal's raw mode.

## 5. Sound effects

Sound effects are declarative `SoundDef` values. A sound contains one or more
layers, optional intermediate buses, and processor chains:

```mermaid
flowchart LR
    Source["oscillator, sweep, FM, noise, impulse, burst, ref"] --> Chain["filter and envelope chain"]
    Chain --> Bus["optional named bus"]
    Bus --> Master["master chain and normalize"]
    Master --> Variants["pre-rendered variants"]
```

Sources include oscillators, sweeps, FM, noise, impulses, burst trains,
references to earlier layers, and silence. Processors include filters,
envelopes/decay, modulation, shaping, clipping, and gain. Validation bounds
duration, frequencies/Nyquist behavior, topology, operation count, and authored
structure before rendering.

At startup the engine:

1. registers `AudioConfig.BaseSounds`, which the game fills from the embedded
   bank in `internal/asset/audio` via `parameter.BuiltinSounds`;
2. loads a resolved optional `audio/sounds.toml`, replacing same-name
   definitions;
3. freezes the name-to-ID registry;
4. pre-renders the variant cache and drum kit;
5. resolves game volume/shape overrides by stable sound name.

Each effect normally has three pre-rendered variants. The mixer rotates variants
to reduce repetition, allows at most two concurrent instances per sound ID and
12 effects globally, and steals according to its admission policy when needed.
Rapid repeats within 250 ms attenuate toward a 0.25 floor and recover over 600
ms. Active effects duck the music bus to 70%, with fast attack and slower
release.

Sound IDs are process-local registration values. Configuration and persistent
documents must use names, not numeric IDs.

## 6. Mixer buses, mute, and pause

Effects and music have independent mute bits. `Ctrl-S` cycles the composed game
mask through silence, effects-only, music-only, and both. The CLI starts muted
by default, and `-mute=false` starts with sound; system and config events can
change channels independently.

Pause is a device/output state, not merely a gameplay-system toggle. It applies
even if `AudioSystem` is disabled and ramps the master gain over 250 ms; music
plays out the ramp, then freezes with its position kept for resume. A run that
ends fades the same way before the engine stops. Muted, `MusicSystem` sends only
what outlasts the mute (patterns, tempo): a start or a note waits for the unmute,
and an unmute does not restart music the run stopped.

Disabling `audio` gates both channels; disabling `music` gates music alone.
Mute keys still update the user's preference, but cannot open a disabled channel.
Re-enabling restores that preference. The status bar reports effective playback,
including a stopped sequencer or unavailable backend. Pause and telemetry remain
connected while disabled, and startup/reset waits for scenario gates to settle.

## 7. Music sequencer

The sequencer uses a 16th-note grid (`4` steps per beat), 4/4 bars, and three
crossfading slots:

| Slot | Conventional role |
|---|---|
| 0 | Rhythm/drums. |
| 1 | Melody/harmony-following layer. |
| 2 | Free layer or automatic phrase fill. |

A pattern has up to 64 steps, 32 tracks, and 512 events per track. Track events
define step position, velocity, scale degree, octave, duration, probability,
instrument, chord-following, and humanization. Tonal voices include bass,
piano/FM, pads, and fallback synthesis; the drum kit uses cached effects.

Tempo is clamped to 80–200 BPM. Tempo changes can wait for the next beat;
patterns can transition immediately or quantized to the bar. The incoming
pattern plays at full level from its first trigger while the outgoing one's
ringing tails fade out, over at least 256 samples so none is hard-cut. A reveal
builds a rising tier up from as many tracks as the outgoing pattern sounded,
adding one a bar, so a build-up never starts thinner than what it replaces. Slot 2 can substitute a seeded fill on the last bar of each
eight-bar phrase and restore the previous pattern on the downbeat; explicit
slot-2 editing disables that surprise behavior.

Drawn music comes from groups. A pattern's `role` (rhythm, melody or fill),
`groups` and `tiers` place it; `Start` builds each group's pool per tier and role
from the registry, and a group shares one bass figure and kick feel, so what it
draws follows what it drew before. The sequencer holds one group: a tier change
draws both slots from it, moving only when it does not cover the tier; each
phrase downbeat swaps one drawn slot, melody and rhythm in turn, within it; and
after four phrases both slots move to another group behind the phrase's fill.
Fills come from the same group and tier. A slot placed explicitly is left alone.

Harmony holds root note, scale, and chord progression. Pattern degrees resolve
through the current harmony at trigger time. With the same seed and identical
bar-aligned command schedule, generated music is reproducible; wall-clock
arrival relative to bars is not a recorded replay contract. The conductor seeds
the sequencer from the run's own music stream, so each run draws its own pools.

## 8. Adaptive game conductor

`MusicSystem` is the conductor. Once per game update it observes five-second
music APM and maps it to:

| APM range | Intensity tier |
|---|---|
| below 60 | Calm |
| 60–139 | Normal |
| 140–219 | Elevated |
| 220–299 | Intense |
| 300 and above | Peak |

The target tempo is `100 + 100·√(APM/480)` BPM: 100 at rest, 135 at 60 APM, 150
at 120, 168 at 220, 179 at 300, and the engine's 200 maximum only at the 480
ceiling, which a pointer alone (six gestures a second, 187 BPM) cannot reach. The
conductor slews rather than jumping (20 BPM/s upward, 16 BPM/s downward), ignores
changes smaller than three BPM until the slew settles on its target, and the
sequencer applies each on the next beat, so tempo trails the five-second window by
about a second. A tier change draws from
the current group under quantization/crossfade/reveal policy, and a slot already
sounding its draw keeps playing. The `music.*` status group (the telemetry HUD's music
card, and the periodic stat log) names the group, tier, requested tempo and the
pattern in each slot, and reads `-` while music is muted or stopped.

Explicit music events can start/stop, set patterns, play a melody note, change
intensity, tempo, seed, swing, or harmony. A manually held intensity can later
be released so APM control resumes. APM policy stays under `internal/parameter`
and `internal/system`, leaving `pkg/audio` reusable.

## 9. Authored music and sound overrides

The service receives optional files resolved through the common config-root
hierarchy:

- `sounds.toml` supplies sound definitions and name-based overrides;
- `music.toml` supplies pattern definitions.

The categorized locations are `audio/sounds.toml` and `audio/music.toml`.
`-config-sounds` and `-config-music` are strict individual overrides. See
[External filesystem layout](filesystem-layout.md).

Malformed user definitions degrade to the shipped bank. Play reports the first
line of the engine's combined specification error on the status bar; `vif -check`
validates and reports both documents in full before startup.

The shipped banks are `internal/asset/audio/sfx.toml`, `drums.toml` and
`music.toml`, embedded and handed to the engine as `BaseSounds` and
`BasePatterns`; `pkg/audio` ships no authored content. `melody_gen` reserves its
fixed ID in code and takes its bass and placement from the bank; the generator
rewrites its second track. Group pools are fixed at `Start`. Later same-name
registrations replace a definition while preserving its runtime ID, which allows
live tooling to update a playing registry.

## 10. Soundlab

`cmd/soundlab` is the supported terminal authoring environment built on the
same engine. It offers:

- a command REPL;
- a full-screen TUI with browser, structural inspector, piano recording, and
  beat-grid editing;
- headless `.slab` script execution;
- validation, live registry apply/revert, audition, sequencer slot assignment,
  TOML save, and WAV export.

Soundlab registers the same sound and pattern banks the game does, from the same
embedded assets, and takes vif's `-config-dir`, `-config-music` and
`-config-sounds`. It resolves both overrides through `internal/paths` exactly as
the game does, registers them, and opens them as its documents, so its registry
and the game's hold identical specs. A save writes back to the file the next run
reads first: the override's own file, or the user root's (or `-config-dir`'s)
when the override came from an installed system root, which it then shadows.

The working document and live registry are separate: edits do not affect audio
until `apply`; `revert` restores the document from the canonical registry. Its
dotted path grammar follows TOML tags and Go types, while domain validation
runs at `validate`/`apply`. See `cmd/soundlab/README.md` for the command/TUI
reference.

## 11. Extension checklist

For a new game sound:

1. author and validate a named sound definition;
2. add it to `internal/asset/audio` or a tested override document;
3. add the semantic name to the game's sound table and volume/shape policy;
4. run startup resolution so a missing mapping fails early;
5. emit `EventSoundRequest` from the mechanic rather than calling the engine
   from arbitrary systems;
6. verify rapid-fire, polyphony, mute, pause, silent-backend, and 256-command
   saturation behavior.

For music, keep new APM/campaign decisions in `MusicSystem` or configuration
events and keep the sequencer unaware of gameplay concepts.
