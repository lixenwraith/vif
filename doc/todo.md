# TODO

Scratch notes that travel with the repository. Each item states what remains and
the smallest thing that would close it. Delete an item when it lands; this file
is not a changelog. Source files do not carry parallel TODO comments, so a
code-originated item names its source here.

Priorities: P0 blocks a release, P1 is wanted next, P2 is convenient follow-up,
and P3 is an idea.

## Browser sessions and mobile

### Exercise the browser path's edges

- Priority: P1
- Affected files: `internal/network/websocket_wasm.go`, `deploy/k3s/30-session.yaml`

A browser guest has joined and played on the deployed node. Not yet run: a dropped
socket rejoining, a suspended tab, and expiry with a browser in the session. The
sidecar's CPU and memory are still the estimate in `30-session.yaml`. The hop costs
about 40 µs a round trip, except that websocat 1.x never sets `TCP_NODELAY`: about
0.5% of browser-to-game frames wait 40–80 ms on a delayed ACK. A bridge that sets it
removes that.

### Restore a per-player bound for browser participants

- Priority: P1
- Affected files: `tool/vif-allocator`, `deploy/website/vif.nginx.example`
- Prerequisite: the browser path is carrying real players

Every browser participant reaches the session pod from `127.0.0.1`, so
`network.AdmissionLimiter` gives the whole browser population one budget instead of
one each. The edge's `limit_conn`/`limit_req` and the allocator's per-session
ceiling stand in for it today. Decide whether that is the answer or whether the
allocator should carry a per-address bound of its own, which means deciding whether
it may trust a forwarded address at all.

### Decide what `page_url` names

- Priority: P1
- Affected files: `tool/vif-allocator/allocator.go`, the site

`page_url` is `-page-base` with the session's NodePort appended, and no deployment
has built the page it names: the reference site has no `session/` tree, so the link
the fleet page renders falls through that server's `try_files` and answers the
homepage with 200. Either build one page that reads its own identifier from the
URL, or drop the field and let `join_target` and `ws_url` be the whole of what a
session publishes.

### Add browser admission authentication

- Priority: P1
- Affected files: allocator/session adapter, website, future authentication
  dependency
- Prerequisite: the unauthenticated browser path is bounded and measured

Issue a short-lived, session-scoped admission credential after authentication and
consume it during the WebSocket handshake without putting it in page history or
logs. Decide whether the expanded allocator remains the credential boundary or is
renamed/split before adding the planned `github.com/lixenwraith/auth`
Argon2-SCRAM dependency.

### Fetch a content-addressed bundle over HTTP

- Priority: P1
- Affected files: `internal/resource`, browser resource provider
- Prerequisite: decide publisher trust, allowed origins, and cache policy; the
  format and the limits are `resource.Scenario`'s and are already decided

Two of the three routes to content exist. A native player downloads the release
wad and extracts it over a config root; a guest joining a session is served the
coordinator's scenario and verifies its digest before constructing its `App`. The
corpus needs neither: it is player domain, resolved per instance and never
reconciled, so a peer holding a different one is not a disagreement to settle.

The third route is a client with no config root and no peer — a WASM build before
it has joined anything, which has no roots at all. An HTTP-backed provider reading
the same content-addressed container is what [Multi-platform](multi-platform.md)
anticipates, and it is one provider for both the browser case and a native player
who would rather fetch a scenario than unpack one. What it needs before it is
written is whose signature makes bytes trustworthy, which origins may serve them,
and how long a fetched container is kept.

### Extract the renderer-neutral Android host model

- Priority: P1
- Affected files: terminal-shaped input/cell/color values, `internal/app`, host
  entry points
- Prerequisite: define the minimum visual and semantic-input contract for the app

Target a minimally polished Android build within one month of development time.
Move terminal-specific visual and input values behind positive renderer/host
adapters, add a library entry point, and keep lifecycle, simulation, networking,
and resource providers common.

## Packaging

Distribution-specific detail lives in [Packaging](packaging.md).

### Promote a nightly build to the first stable release

- Priority: P0
- Affected files: `doc/packaging.md`, `README.md`
- Prerequisite: choose a nightly commit after the complete verification gate
  passes

Tag the selected commit `v0.1.0` and publish the draft release the tag creates,
which already carries the source archive and its checksum; then drop the "no final
release" lines in `README.md` and [Packaging](packaging.md) §2.

### Publish a development AUR package

- Priority: P3
- Affected files: AUR packaging metadata and `doc/packaging.md`
- Prerequisite: establish the release-package metadata first

Publish `vif-git` alongside the release-based AUR package.

### Let a request name the map size

- Priority: P2
- Affected files: `tool/vif-allocator/config.go`, `tool/vif-allocator/allocator.go`,
  the Hugo site's `vif-fleet.js`

`-map-size` is the deployment's for every session, and the session page cannot
select it. A scenario that fixes its own dimensions ignores it — `td` emits
`EventLevelSetup` at 500x250 — so the flag only decides the scenarios that do not,
and those all run at one size. Offer it the way `scenarios` is offered, bounded by
`parameter.MaxMapCells` rather than by a list: `limits` names the ceiling, a
request names a size under it, and a scenario that sets its own still wins.

### Provision audio to the fleet when a host needs it

- Priority: P3
- Affected files: `deploy/guest/update-vif-wad.sh`, `tool/vif-allocator/manifest.go`,
  `deploy/k3s/30-session.yaml`

What a fleet session reads from the node volume is one list in three places —
`categories` in the installer, `wadCategories` in the allocator, and the mounts in
the template. `scenario` and `image` are on it. `audio` goes on it the day a
dedicated host renders anything, and `content` never does. Nothing else changes;
the volume already carries whatever the installer puts there.

### Cache a received scenario to the user root

- Priority: P3
- Affected files: `internal/resource`, `internal/app/session.go`

A scenario received from a coordinator lives in memory and is dropped at exit, so
rejoining the same session downloads it again. Writing it under the user root
behind an explicit opt-in would keep it, and needs a trust decision first: the
bytes came from a peer, and nothing about a plaintext link says they are the
operator's.

## Multiplayer

Diagnoses and what each item follows from are in
[Troubleshooting](troubleshooting.md).

### Converge participants behind a relay

- Priority: P1
- Affected files: `internal/system/network.go`, `internal/converge/relay.go`,
  `internal/converge/correction.go`, `internal/converge/selective.go`

In a tree of four (1–2, 2–3, 2–4) at four-tick links, paced one path behind the
authority, participant 2 answers 96% of manifests hash-only and 3 and 4 none. Causes:

- `ownLead` measures the link to the authority, which a leaf lacks, so its lead is
  the default 3 ticks against 11 on a direct guest and nearly every crossing it
  makes commits late (385 in 400 ticks).
- A repair too wide to relay sets a leaf's `wantKeyframe`; a relay refuses every
  keyframe request, and only a whole world clears the latch.
- `allProvedLocked` and `canAnswerEveryParticipantLocked` read direct peers only, so
  the relay's own proofs can suppress the floor and the flood behind it.

Shipped sessions are stars, so no player meets this yet. Undecided is what a relay
owes its leaves: forward the authority's exchange to them as if direct, or serve
their corrections itself from worlds it has proved, with keyframes a leaf verifies
against the authority's root and one proof per subtree upstream. The authority stays
the only commit point either way. Keeping the floor for every participant no direct
proof covers is the stopgap under both.

### Reduce exact snapshot and navigation costs at the map limit

- Priority: P1
- Affected files: `internal/snapshot`, `internal/app/capture.go`,
  `internal/engine/snapshot_delta.go`, `internal/gen-manifest`, `pkg/navigation`

At td with 16 players the host spends about 1.2 of its 1.4 CPU-s/s on protocol and
an instance averages about 250 MiB of heap, against the pod's 500m and 160 MiB
(multi-player §6). Per round the seal (about 65 ms) now costs twice the index, whose
remainder is mostly the static wall positions. Each step below must stay exact:

- Reuse the wall store's own encoding in `Integrity` and the capture encoders, under
  the builder's owned-value comparison: each seal and keyframe re-encodes every wall.
- Reuse the row encodings of unchanged entries in every store. That also replaces
  the wall special case in `ManifestBuilder` with a table indexed by store.
- Generate typed comparisons for `DiffCapture` and `countStoreDifference`, which
  call `reflect.DeepEqual` per entry.
- Measure navigation's share again, then exact storage and loop work in
  `FlowField.Compute` with identical directions, distances and throttle phase.

Per-store write counters stay rejected: a cache compares values it owns.

### Decide the authority's fan-out and publication cadence

- Priority: P2
- Affected files: `internal/system/network.go`, `internal/converge/correction.go`

A star's authority relays every participant's epochs and owner syncs to every other:
at 16 players 4,444 epochs and 736 syncs a second, 1.4 MB/s framed on the tower map
and 2.8 MB/s on td before deflate. Rounds follow the union of peer deadlines, 7.2 a
second at td, and whole bodies add 2.2 MB/s there. Candidates, each a message-set or
cadence change: one bundle per guest per tick carrying every source's committed
frames with their epoch markers, which pacing and fences read; owner syncs as deltas;
and rounds aligned across peers.

### Project a correction outside the live lock

- Priority: P2
- Affected files: `internal/app/snapshot_stage.go`

At td an install that projects nothing already holds the live lock 40–70 ms for the
capture pair, comparison and write, and each projected tick adds up to a simulation
tick, so a repair 16 ticks behind holds it past 100 ms. Reduce the O(E) part first.
Any out-of-lock or incremental design must keep §3.3: fence membership, pending
barrier crossings not fed, the ledger settled before projection, the journal's place
and mark, and no live tick between the final projection and the write. WASM gains
scheduling time, not parallel CPU.

### Add a UDP transport

- Priority: P2
- Affected files: `internal/network/endpoint.go`, `internal/network/connection.go`, `internal/app/netem_test.go`

`udp://` parses and is refused. Everything above the dial assumes an ordered,
reliable byte stream: the flate stream spans messages, and handshakes, captures and
crossings rely on arrival order. UDP therefore means a reliable ordered stream over
datagrams presented as a `net.Conn` to `Peer`: selective acks, a retransmit timer
set from the tick rather than TCP's minimum RTO, and the compressor reset per
window or moved to per-message deflate. Its gain is recovery in tens of
milliseconds and no connection-wide stall on one lost segment; measure it against
TCP under the `netem` stages at 1-10% loss before changing the default.

## Combat

### Let mounted weapons strike more than cursors

- Priority: P3
- Affected files: `internal/system/mount.go`, `internal/profile/combat.go`

A mounted beam destroying walls and glyphs, mounted weapons striking other species, and each instance's own drains; Shared outcomes must resolve from Shared geometry, not a Player-domain shot.

### Let cursor weapons strike other cursors

- Priority: P3
- Affected files: `internal/system/weapon.go`, `internal/system/bullet.go`, `internal/profile/combat.go`

PvP: a hit on a remote cursor crosses as its impact and the victim's owner applies it, as `strikeCursor` does for mounts.

### Fan a fully charged beam into spokes

- Priority: P3
- Affected files: `internal/system/weapon.go`, `internal/component/beam.go`

Charges beyond the ray could add rays 360°/n apart, one through the orb; a sweep already passes each target once a turn, so spokes trade coverage for crossings.

### Move storm's green circle onto a disruptor mount

- Priority: P3
- Affected files: `internal/system/storm.go`

Its area pulse is the hosted disruptor's shape; the red circle's turret mount is the pattern.

### Route species contact damage through strikeCursor

- Priority: P3
- Affected files: `internal/system/{quasar,swarm,storm,eye,pylon,snake,drain}.go`

Each still writes the shield-drain-or-heat pair by hand; `TestSharedCursorOverlapOutcomesStayOwnerResolved` counts must move with it.

## Rendering

### Use sixteen console backgrounds on Linux

- Priority: P3
- Affected files: `internal/render/console.go`

The framebuffer console shows a bright background under SGR 5, which vgacon blinks instead; telling them apart would give Linux FreeBSD's sixteen backgrounds.

### Draw the flow-field debug view from console glyphs

- Priority: P3
- Affected files: `internal/render/renderer/flow_debug.go`

Its diagonal arrows and `◆●` are missing from console fonts, so in 256 colours the view shows their fallbacks.

## Fleet logging

### Repin LogWisp past the fleet stream fixes

- Priority: P1
- Affected files: `deploy/logwisp/REVISION`
- Prerequisite: the quiet-stream keepalive and the rotated-file resume reaching
  LogWisp `main`, which the installer requires the pin to descend from

`REVISION` names v0.18.1, which predates both. Until it moves, a vacant node still
idle-expires a connected viewer and evicts it on the next session's first record,
and a session crossing the 8 MiB file cap still replays its rotated log whole,
spending the rate limit on duplicates while live records drop.
[Deploying the session fleet](kube-docker-deploy.md) §10 states what the pin must
carry.
