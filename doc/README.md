# vif Engineering Documentation

This directory describes the architecture and design of the current vif
codebase. It was last audited on 2026-09-19, through the build-capability split,
browser boundary, correction and authority protocol in `internal/converge`, the
crossing barrier it orders against, the shared-world capture that a mid-run join
installs, the CLI flag surface, and every entry in the multiplayer remaining-gaps
list.
The implementation, generated manifest, and shipped configuration were treated as
authoritative where older prose disagreed with the code.

vif is a terminal action game that combines vi-style text navigation,
typing, shooting, data-driven encounters, adaptive species navigation, procedural
audio, and a custom ECS. The documentation separates those concerns so that a
reader can start with the application shape and then descend into a subsystem.

  detail.
- [TODO](todo.md) is the running work list the packaging checklists feed.
- [Bots](todo-bots.md) is the working plan for bots and relayed seats, and becomes
  their document as its stages land.

  species state machines and data-driven species behavior.
- [Keymap example](../internal/input/README.md) shows sparse key overrides.

## Source-of-truth map

The repository uses generated registries and data-driven configuration. When
changing a subsystem, update the source that actually owns its shape.

| Concern | Authoritative source | Generated or runtime consumer |
|---|---|---|
| Components, systems, renderers | `internal/manifest/definition.go` | `internal/manifest/build_gen.go`, `build_audio_gen.go`, `build_noaudio_gen.go`, `render_gen.go`, `internal/engine/component_store_gen.go` |
| Build capabilities | build constraints in `internal/app/presentation_*`, `audio*`, and `network_*` | Makefile profiles and generated capability-specific builders |
| System domain profiles and dependencies | `SystemDef.Domain`/`Requires` in `internal/manifest/definition.go` | `manifest.ProfileFor`/`SystemProfiles`, `World.SystemInitOrder`, `app.checkSystems` |
| Event names, payload association, replication class | `internal/event/type.go` comments and constants | `internal/event/registry_gen.go` |
| Runtime shape and deterministic harness | `internal/app/config.go`, `headless.go`, `script.go` | `App`, `Scheduler`, services |
| Replay journal format, recording/replay drivers, and authored scripts | `internal/event/journal.go`, `origin.go`, `internal/journal` | `internal/app/replay.go`, `play.go`, `script.go` |
| Correction cadence, selective repair, authority term and succession | `internal/converge` | `App.corrections`/`authority`/`reach` through `converge.Instance`; its criteria run against a stub world |
| Cursor lifecycle, roster, and local selection | `internal/system/cursor.go`, `internal/engine/resource.go` | FSM cursor events, mode routing, per-slot metrics |
| Shared-world capture layout and its declared carriers | `internal/snapshot/capture.go`, `internal/app/capture.go`, `SystemDef.Snapshot` in `internal/manifest/definition.go` | `internal/engine/snapshot_world_gen.go`, `internal/app/snapshot_stage.go`, `internal/network/snapshot.go` |
| Input enum string forms | input enum definitions | `internal/input/strings_gen.go` |
| Shipped encounter progression | `internal/asset/scenario/*.toml` | `internal/fsm`, `internal/engine.Scheduler` |
| Embedded fallback progression | `internal/asset/scenario/*.toml` | the same, when no root supplies one |
| Alternate scenarios | `wad/scenario/blank`, `wad/scenario/td` | selected by name or path with `-s` |
| Gameplay tuning | `internal/parameter` and `internal/parameter/visual` | systems and renderers |
| Embedded fallback corpus | `internal/asset/content/*.toml` | content service |
| Built-in sound bank | `internal/asset/audio/*.toml` | `parameter.BuiltinSounds`, `AudioConfig.BaseSounds` |
| External package versions | `go.mod` | Go module resolver |

Run `make generate` after changing a manifest or generator input. Do not edit a
generated file by hand.

## Accuracy conventions

This documentation distinguishes three states:

- **Active** means constructed and used by the normal `cmd/vif` runtime.
- **Optional** means supported by an explicit flag, config, build tag, or tool.
- **Experimental/incomplete** means code exists but the normal application does
  not expose a complete end-to-end feature. Authenticated multiplayer is an
  example: the message kinds are reserved and nothing populates them. Startup
  multi-participant networking is optional and active, and so are mid-run join and
  reconnect (`:host <addr>`) and host authority with periodic correction. What is
  not active is *adaptive* cadence: the host publishes at a fixed rate rather than
  one driven by the link.

Performance and determinism statements are intentionally scoped. Several hot
paths reuse buffers and avoid routine allocation, but the application is not
globally allocation-free. A caller-driven App is a pure function of its seed,
config, and injected events for one implementation build. Simulation motion,
geometry, and physics use `float64`, so that is not a cross-platform lockstep
guarantee; live play adds concurrent scheduling and is not the source class for
which bit-exact replay is claimed.
