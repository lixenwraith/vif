# Telemetry audit

This audit covers every system constructed by `manifest.BuildSystems`, `MetaSystem`, and telemetry owned by `internal/engine` and `internal/event`. The table describes the final wiring; the defect table preserves the Phase 1 findings from the pre-fix tree.

Every metric is consumed generically by the status snapshot, telemetry overlay, pinning UI, and `vif-log` registry traversal. “Generic only” means no code or configuration reads the key by name outside its producer. Player patterns expand across roster slots 0–15 and retain the legacy slot-zero mirror; inactive slots keep their frozen schema but are omitted from live views and output until active. Stable keys project into semantic groups of at most 15 fields for overlay and log presentation.

| Audio | `audio.{backend,silent,played,dropped,mask,effect_muted,music_muted,rej_*}` | `NewAudioSystem` | Session deltas from backend/update | `Init` with backend baselines | `audio.mask` is read by the status bar; remainder generic |

| Music | None | — | — | — | — |
| Meta | `context.{map_w,map_h,camera_x,camera_y}`, `player.<slot>.{x,y}`, `kills.{<species>,total,uncredited}`, `session.{any_defeated,all_defeated}` | `NewMetaSystem` | Debug/map publication, lifecycle fold and resolved species-kill handler | `Init` | Kill keys and `session.any_defeated` are shipped FSM guards; remainder generic |
| Network | `network.{crossings_sent,crossings_received,state_applied,frames_dropped,barrier_deferred,barrier_applied_local,barrier_applied_peer,barrier_late,barrier_ran_without_peer,barrier_peer_lag_ticks,barrier_peer_artifacts,barrier_peer_applied,peers,connected,state,map_latched,artifacts_pre_install,artifacts_refused,corrections_received,join_lag_ticks,lag_ticks,stale,digest_mismatches,drift_part,drift_tick}`, `context.map_locked` | `NewNetworkSystem` | Transport polling, playout admission, cursor sync, connection state and the running staleness measurement | `Init` | Status bar reads peer/state/latch, `stale`/`lag_ticks` and the `link_rtt_ms`/`link_loss_pct` pair; remainder generic |
| Snapshot transfer | `snapshot.{bytes,capture_us,encode_us,stage_us,commit_us,install_tick,catch_up_ticks,keyframes,corrections_sent,correction_bytes_sent,corrections_applied,corrections_refused,corrections_superseded,corrections_held,correction_entries,correction_entities,correction_cells,correction_tick}` | `snapshot.NewTelemetry` during App construction | A capture read, a correction published, or a correction installed | **Not reset** — a join is not undone by `:new`, and these describe a transfer rather than a game | Generic only; the whole prefix is excluded from the compared shared surface *and* from a replay comparison: a host publishes what a read cost, a guest what an install cost and how far its own prediction had drifted, and under weakened D-11 the last of those is deliberately not something two instances agree on |
| Selective correction | `snapshot.{manifests_sent,manifests_received,manifest_bytes_sent,manifest_bytes_received,corrections_hash_only,sections_compared,pages_compared,hash_us,selective_bytes,shards_requested,shards_sent,shards_received,shards_refused,shards_applied,shard_bytes_sent,shard_bytes_received,request_bytes,pages_repaired,entities_repaired,cells_repaired,proof_failures,baseline_refusals,keyframe_fallbacks,replay_suffix_records,replay_records,replay_overflow,replay_skipped,replay_suffix_unavailable}` | `snapshot.NewTelemetry` during App construction | Every index published or answered, every repair served or applied, every correction that replayed a local suffix | **Not reset** — like the rest of the prefix, these describe transfers rather than a game | Generic only; excluded from the compared surface with the whole `snapshot.` prefix. They are split across the `snapshot.index`, `snapshot.repair` and `snapshot.replay` cards so each stays inside `OverlayCardMaxEntries` |
| Correction cadence | `snapshot.cadence_{ticks,keyframe_interval,keyframe_period_ticks,keyframe_age_ticks,uplink_bps,budget_bps,floor_bps,constrained,floor_breached}` | `snapshot.NewTelemetry` during App construction | Every publication decision, and every correction a guest applies | **Not reset** — the operating point describes this instance's link, which a `:new` does not change | Generic only; excluded from the shared surface with the rest of the prefix. Network timing may pace a transport and may not enter shared simulation state (D-24), and `TestLinkMeasurementNeverEntersTheComparedSurface` is the assertion from the other direction |
| Authority term | `network.{term,authority,migrations,term_refused,term_stale,handoff_bytes,fork,migrating,host_lost}` | `newAuthority` during App construction, and `snapshot.NewTelemetry` for the two byte/stale counters | Every offer, handoff, refusal and succession this instance takes part in | **Not reset** — a `:new` restarts the game inside a session, not the session | Status bar reads `fork`, `migrating` and `host_lost`; `:session` reads the term and holder |
| Reachability | `network.{chain,rejoin_attempts,listening}` | `newReach` during App construction | The succession loop, once per drive: the chain size, the retry pass count, and whether this instance bound a port | **Not reset** — a reset does not unbind a socket or forget where the other participants are | `:session` reports the chain size as "confirmed reachable"; the status bar reads the retry count |
| Relay retention | `snapshot.relay_{retained,served,unserved,bytes_sent,bytes_received}` | `snapshot.NewTelemetry` during App construction | Every repair a relaying participant serves, refuses or forwards from its own retention | **Not reset** — like the rest of the prefix, these describe transfers rather than a game | Generic only; the bytes are priced against the relaying participant's own link, never the authority's |
| Link measurement | `network.link_{rtt_ms,rtt_us,jitter_ms,bps,loss_pct,saturated}` | `NewNetworkSystem` | Every tick, copied from the transport's own per-peer estimate for the worst link | Cleared with the rest of `NetworkSystem`'s counters on a session reset | Generic only; the `network.` prefix is already the exact complement of a peer's counters. Nothing here is derived by a system — the estimate is the transport's and this is a copy, which is what keeps a round trip out of the simulation |

## Engine and event audit

| Owner | Metric keys | Registered | Written | Reset | Named consumer |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| Game context | `engine.fps`, `context.{frame,screen_w,screen_h,mode}` | `NewGameContextWithClock` | Presentation/context owners | Context lifecycle | Status bar reads `engine.fps`; snapshot allow-list reads context keys |
| Time control | `engine.{speed_pct,speed,step,breakpoint,paused}` | `NewTimeControl` | Time-control mutation under its owner lock | Time-control reset/persistent operator state | Status bar and app snapshot read these keys |
| Scheduler / world | `engine.{ticks,apm,music_apm,tick_slips}`, `entity.{count,created_total,destroyed_total}`, `time.game_elapsed_ms`, `event.{backoffs,dispatches,dead,dropped,queue_len,queue_max,invalid,settle_*}`, `fsm.*` | `NewScheduler`; schema-derived region keys bind before `Prepare` | Dispatch/tick tail while the world mutex is held | `resetTelemetry` during reset | Status bar reads tick/APM/FSM; region/debug metrics are generic |
| Event queue | Per-type `[EventTypeCount]atomic.Int64` dispatch/dead arrays; surfaced as `event.{dispatch_by_type,dead_by_type}` | Fixed arrays in `NewEventQueue`; strings in scheduler constructor | Scheduler records after routing; strings publish every `StatSnapshotTicks` | `ResetTelemetry` after stale-event drain | Generic only |
| Profiler | `prof.{<phase>_us,tick_max_us,frame_max_us}`, `prof.top.<rank>`, `proc.{cpu_user_pct,cpu_sys_pct,rss_peak_mb,mem_mb,heap_live_mb,alloc_mb_s,allocs_s,gc_s,goroutines,io_read_s,io_write_s,csw_s,preempt_s}` | `prof.New` in `newGameContext` | Once per `ProfWindow` of running game while `:d prof` is on; zeroed when it stops | **Not reset** — they measure the process | Generic only; activity-gated, so the cards hide while off, and excluded from both comparison surfaces |
| Position/spatial grid | `spatial.{cell_saturations,cell_overflows,occupied_cells,indexed_entities,unindexed,max_cell_occupancy,cell_occupancy_hwm,positions_hwm,position_batch_hwm}` | `BindTelemetry` immediately after registry construction | Position mutations under the world mutex; expensive gauges on snapshot cadence | `World.Clear` | Generic only |

## Phase 1 defects and dispositions

| Finding | Keys | Pre-fix evidence | Disposition |
|---|---|---|---|
| Late registration | `context.{map_w,map_h,camera_x,camera_y}`, `player.{x,y}`, `kills.*` | `MetaSystem.Init` called `Get` / `NewPlayerInt` and was re-entered on game reset | Moved every registration to `NewMetaSystem`; `Init` now only stores/resets |
| Dead metrics | `energy.{penalty_count,reward_count}`, `environment.wind_active`, `nav.roi_cells` | Registered but never written after construction/reset | Wired to resolved deltas, the live wind gauge, and clamped recompute ROI area |
| Suspected but not dead | `combat.{hits_direct,hits_area,knockbacks,stuns}` | All four had writes, but direct/area counted accepted profiles before state resolution | Retained keys and moved hit increments to resolved damage/effect/chain paths |
| Unreset metrics | `drain.{spawned,fusions,despawned,spawn_failures}`, all `eye.ga.*`, `nav.{entities,recomputes,roi_cells}`, `storm.nudge_count`, audio backend totals, scheduler session totals | Written values survived `EventGameResetRequest` | All session counters/strings now reset in `Init` or the scheduler reset path; audio publishes deltas from reset baselines |
| Misleading gauge | `drain.count` | Used `Drain.CountEntities()`, including entities with death already queued; pause forced a false zero | Publishes only live, non-dying drains and preserves the live gauge while paused |
| Misleading counters | `dust.created`, `swarm.player_kills`, `combat.hits_*`, audio totals | Dust counted dark entries it skipped; swarm counted every HP death as a player kill; combat counted pre-resolution; audio exposed backend-lifetime totals | Counts now follow actual creation, resolved cursor credit, state-changing attacks, and session deltas |
| Consumerless by key | Most diagnostic counters, including all newly added coverage | No exact-key lookup outside the producer | Deliberately retained: the telemetry overlay, pinned cards, snapshots, recorder, and `vif-log` enumerate the registry generically |
| Removed/renamed keys | `death.one_packed`, `death.one_fallback` | Baseline registry had 488 keys; the Phase 1 result had 752 | Death API unification retired the two obsolete one-entity path counters; the current registry has 750 keys, a net 262 additions |

## Deliberately unchanged or excluded

- Schema-derived `fsm.<region>.*` keys still bind during FSM loading because region names do not exist when the scheduler constructor runs. Binding completes before `Scheduler.Prepare` freezes the registry, and the freeze regression test proves that no key is added afterward.
- The position store binds its metrics immediately after `NewGameContextWithClock` creates the registry; `World` necessarily constructs the store before that registry exists. It is frozen before the first tick and never registers during reset.
- Legacy slot-zero mirrors such as `energy.current`, `heat.current`, and `player.x` remain intact for existing status-bar/config consumers.
- Registry-owned `content.*`, `rec.*`, and `stat.*` metrics and persistent operator/context settings are excluded from session-zero assertions. Reset tests seed and verify every session-owned int, bool, and string; live gauges are allowed to rebuild to their deterministic reset values.
- Systems with no existing counters and no reusable allocation-shaped buffers remain metric-free.
- `hitComposite.members` in the explosion path remains a fresh queued-payload slice, not a reusable system buffer; reusing it would corrupt queued events.
- Event-type arrays remain internal fixed atomics and are formatted only at `parameter.StatSnapshotTicks`, avoiding per-event formatting/allocation.

| `combat.live_<type>` (int) | Live population of the Combat store per entity type, one key per `combatEntityNames` entry. Decomposes `combat.count`: a type still counted while its species reports inactive is a lifecycle leak. |
| `combat.relation_rejects` (int) | Direct-hit requests rejected because the hit entity was not a member of the target composite. |
| `combat.stun_immune_rejects` (int) | Stun effects rejected by species/state immunity. |
| `combat.target_rejects` (int) | Attack requests rejected because the target or required target member lacked combat state. |

| `heat.cursor_rejects` (int) | Requests rejected because heat could not resolve a roster cursor. |

| `loot.boundary_reflections` (int) | Resolved loot reflections at simulation bounds. |
| `loot.buf_pity_hwm` (int) | High-water live length of the reusable pity buffer/state collection. |
| `loot.buf_routes_hwm` (int) | High-water count of owner flow fields held at once. |
| `loot.routes` (int) | Owner flow fields currently held: one per cursor that has dropped something and still exists. |
| `loot.route_recomputes` (int) | Owner flow fields rebuilt, cumulative. A drop in flight rebuilds its owner's field when that cursor moves past the dirty distance, so this rises with player movement while loot is out and not otherwise. |
| `loot.unreachable` (int) | Drops with no route home this tick: their owner is gone, or walls seal them off. They bleed to rest rather than press against what is in the way, so a sustained nonzero reading is geometry, not motion. |
| `loot.physics_steps` (int) | Physics integration substeps executed for loot movers. |
| `loot.wall_collisions` (int) | Resolved loot contacts with blocking wall cells. |
| `missile.boundary_hits` (int) | missile swept paths terminated at simulation bounds. |

| `mount.count` (int) | Shared hosts carrying a mounted weapon. |
| `mount.disabled_rejects` (int) | Action requests dropped while the mount system was disabled. |
| `mount.fired` (int) | Mounted discharges; a beam counts once per warn-fire cycle. |

| `nugget.disabled_rejects` (int) | Action requests dropped while the nugget system was disabled. |
| `nugget.spawn_failures` (int) | nugget spawn requests that could not produce an entity. |
| `network.barrier_applied_local` (int) | Local artifacts admitted at their playout boundary, which is every crossing this participant produces. |
| `network.barrier_applied_peer` (int) | Peer artifacts admitted at their playout boundary. |
| `network.barrier_deferred` (int) | Local crossing artifacts the barrier took ownership of at production, to apply at the agreed tick. |
| `network.barrier_late` (int) | Artifacts admitted after their scheduled apply tick. Under an authority this is an ordering decision rather than a divergence — the host applies what reaches it in the order it reaches it — but it is still what says a participant's link is not keeping the playout lead. |
| `network.barrier_peer_applied` (bool) | Whether the most recent boundary admitted a peer artifact. |
| `network.barrier_peer_artifacts` (int) | Peer artifacts admitted at the most recent boundary. |
| `network.barrier_peer_lag_ticks` (int) | Closed-epoch lag beyond this instance's own lead, over live participants; zero on the authority, which commits a late crossing rather than waiting for it. |
| `network.pace_late_ticks` (int) | How late the latest authority epoch of the pacing window landed on this guest, in ticks; negative is early. |
| `network.pace_trim_permille` (int) | The trim pacing applies to this guest's tick interval; positive runs it slower. |
| `network.pace_steps` (int) | Whole-tick steps pacing took, for an error too large to trim away. |
| `network.commit_late` (int) | On the authority: guest crossings that reached it after their tick and were committed at its next one. |
| `network.commit_void` (int) | The subset too late to apply, which only closed their source's fence. |
| `network.commit_refused_raw` (int) | On a guest: another participant's raw epochs, passed on toward the authority and not applied. |
| `network.evicted` (int) | Participants the slow policy dropped while this instance authored. |
| `network.barrier_ran_without_peer` (int) | Tick boundaries reached before every required peer epoch marker; the authority requires none. |
| `network.crossings_received` (int) | Peer crossing artifacts decoded and admitted. |
| `network.crossings_sent` (int) | Local crossing artifacts sent in closed epochs. |
| `network.corrections_received` (int) | Authoritative corrections reassembled from the wire. |
| `network.artifacts_refused` (int) | Peer artifacts refused: an arrival or a departure produced by a participant that is not the coordinator, or a raw epoch under an identity whose own link it did not arrive on. |
| `network.digest_mismatches` (int) | Runtime parity samples that disagreed. A gauge under weakened D-11, not a fault: a guest differs from the host between corrections by design. |
| `network.drift_part` (string) | The surface the last disagreement was in: positions, kinetics, combat, context, status or snapshot. |
| `network.drift_tick` (int) | The tick it was seen on. |
| `network.lag_ticks` (int) | How far behind the newest tick any peer has been seen closing this instance stands, measured every tick. |
| `network.stale` (bool) | Whether that lag exceeds the playout lead, past which this participant's own crossings reach the host after the ticks they name. Shown in the status bar as `desync t`, since the delay a player reads is the round trip beside it. |
| `network.connected` (bool) | Whether at least one session peer is currently connected. |
| `network.frames_dropped` (int) | Transport frames rejected by encoding, framing, ordering or identity checks. |
| `network.map_latched` (bool) | Whether the host-authored D-14 map dimensions are latched. |
| `network.peers` (int) | Current connected session-peer count. |
| `network.state` (string) | Operator connection state: off, connecting, connected or disconnected. |
| `network.state_applied` (int) | Owner-authored cursor snapshots applied to remote cursors. |
| `network.artifacts_pre_install` (int) | Peer artifacts refused because the installed world already contains them — everything due at or before a capture's tick (D-22). Non-zero on a joiner is the ordering working, not a loss. |
| `network.artifacts_refused_tick` (int) | Peer artifacts naming an apply tick past `parameter.NetworkApplyWindowTicks` ahead of this instance. The window admits a fresh join's whole catch-up, so a non-zero count is a sender whose ticks are not a participant's position. |
| `network.artifacts_schedule_full` (int) | Peer artifacts turned away because the barrier schedule was at `NetworkScheduledMax` entries or `NetworkScheduledBytes`. Distinct from `frames_dropped`: these are frames this instance read and refused, which is a different diagnosis from one it could not read. |
| `network.join_lag_ticks` (int) | Ticks this participant still stood behind the session after its join caught up. Zero is the ordinary result; anything above the playout lead refuses the join. |
| `network.link_rtt_ms` (int) | The worst peer's smoothed round trip, in milliseconds — the unit a person reads and the unit `tc netem delay` speaks. A measured one is at least 1, so a loopback link reads as fast rather than unmeasured. The status bar and `:session` read it. |
| `network.link_jitter_ms` (int) | Its smoothed variation. A cadence is held at or above twice this: publishing faster than a link's own timing noise only bunches corrections. |
| `network.link_bps` (int) | The delivery rate that link was measured at, in bytes per second. Read it with `link_saturated`: a rate measured while nothing was queued is a lower bound on capacity and not a measurement of it. |
| `network.link_loss_pct` (int) | The share of probes charged as lost: sent while no echo had come back for `NetworkProbeLostAfter`. A slow echo is latency, not loss, and a probe is the only loss signal this protocol has. The badge names it past `StatusNetLossWarnPct`; `:session` always prints it. |
| `network.link_saturated` (bool) | Whether the link, rather than the sender, was the limit while `link_bps` was measured — from a standing backlog or a round trip inflated past its own baseline. |
| `network.term` (int) | The authority term this instance is acting under. Every authoritative artifact carries the term it was produced under; one from an older term is ignored and one from a term nobody handed this instance is refused. |
| `network.authority` (int) | The participant currently authoring the shared world. Equal to this instance's own identity exactly while it is the authority. |
| `network.migrations` (int) | Handoffs this instance has taken part in, as successor or as follower. |
| `network.term_refused` (int) | Artifacts refused for naming a term nobody handed this instance: a fork that has been running separately, or an instance that skipped a succession. Distinct from `term_stale`, which is the ordinary in-flight case. |
| `network.term_stale` (int) | Artifacts dropped as belonging to a generation the session has left. Non-zero across every handoff and not an error — the frames were in flight when the term changed. |
| `network.handoff_bytes` (int) | What one succession cost this instance on the wire: reports, votes and the handoff record. |
| `network.fork` (bool) | This instance could not reach the successor the roster designated and is continuing as an explicit local fork. Shown in the status bar. |
| `network.migrating` (bool) | A succession is in progress. Dials are refused while it is set, because an offer written now would name a term that is about to end. Shown in the status bar as `Migrating`. |
| `network.host_lost` (bool) | The authority went and this instance is continuing locally from the last authoritative state. Shown in the status bar and named in `:session`. |
| `network.chain` (int) | Participants in the succession chain — the candidate list, which is also the address book a survivor dials down. `:session` reports it as "confirmed reachable"; a participant that declared no port is in the session and playing but is never elected. |
| `network.rejoin_attempts` (int) | Passes this instance has made down that chain while the authority was gone and it had no link to whoever is taking over. Zero once a link is open. |
| `network.listening` (bool) | Whether this instance bound a port peers can dial it back on. False on a leaf — a `-no-advertise` run, or one whose bind failed — which plays normally and is never elected. |
| `ping.cursor_rejects` (int) | Requests rejected because ping could not resolve a roster cursor. |
| `snapshot.bytes` (int) | Encoded length of the last shared-world capture this instance read. |
| `snapshot.capture_us` (int) | What that read cost under the world lock — the one stall a join is allowed. |
| `snapshot.encode_us` (int) | What encoding it cost outside the lock, which stalls nothing. |
| `snapshot.stage_us` (int) | What resolving the last received capture into a staging world cost. |
| `snapshot.commit_us` (int) | What writing it into the live world cost. |
| `snapshot.install_tick` (int) | The tick the last installed capture described. |
| `snapshot.catch_up_ticks` (int) | Ticks simulated after the install to close the gap the transfer opened. |
| `snapshot.keyframes` (int) | Whole captures this host has published, as a join's gate or as a cadence keyframe. |
| `snapshot.corrections_sent` (int) | Corrections broadcast, keyframes and deltas together. |
| `snapshot.correction_bytes_sent` (int) | Their total encoded size, which is the uplink the cadence costs. |
| `snapshot.corrections_applied` (int) | Corrections this instance installed. |
| `snapshot.corrections_refused` (int) | Corrections that could not be resolved — a delta naming a keyframe this instance does not hold, or a body its header does not describe. Not an error: the next keyframe is self-sufficient. |
| `snapshot.corrections_superseded` (int) | Corrections a fresher one overtook before they were applied, plus any the queue dropped. |
| `snapshot.correction_entries` (int) | Component cells the last correction moved: how far this instance's prediction had drifted when the authority arrived. |
| `snapshot.correction_entities` (int) | The distinct shared entities behind them. |
| `snapshot.correction_cells` (int) | The largest distance a shared placement moved — the correction a player would actually see. |
| `snapshot.correction_tick` (int) | The tick the last applied correction described. |
| `snapshot.corrections_held` (int) | Corrections the playout buffer deferred because this instance had not reached the tick they describe. Nonzero says the exchange paths are delivering worlds of different ages, which is the ordinary case on a link with a round trip; a steady rise with no corrections applied beside it is the buffer stalling rather than smoothing. |
| `snapshot.corrections_jumped` (int) | Corrections further ahead of the clock than the lead, adopted at their own tick rather than waited for: a join, or a clock this instance had fallen behind. |
| `snapshot.projected_ticks` (int) | How far behind the clock the last correction was, which is the distance the staging world simulated it forward before the install; zero when it was level. |
| `snapshot.cadence_ticks` (int) | The correction cadence in force, in ticks. The publication timeline's base — the fastest peer's plan — rather than any one peer's, which `:session` and `CadenceReport` name individually. |
| `snapshot.cadence_keyframe_interval` (int) | Corrections between whole captures at that cadence. |
| `snapshot.cadence_keyframe_period_ticks` (int) | Their product: the ticks the session leaves between whole authoritative worlds. This is the value the convergence floor bounds, and the first one to read — a value above `SnapshotFloorKeyframeTicks` is a defect in the controller rather than a slow link. |
| `snapshot.cadence_keyframe_age_ticks` (int) | The *receiving* end of the same guarantee: how long this instance has actually gone without a whole authoritative world. The host promises one per floor window; this says whether one arrived. |
| `snapshot.cadence_uplink_bps` (int) | What the schedule in force costs, in bytes per second. |
| `snapshot.cadence_budget_bps` (int) | What the tightest link was measured to allow after the utilisation share. Zero means no link has been measured *while saturated*, which on a loopback or a fat link is the ordinary case. |
| `snapshot.cadence_floor_bps` (int) | What the convergence floor costs on a world this size: the cheapest schedule that still delivers a whole world per floor window. A budget below it is the unrecoverable condition. |
| `snapshot.cadence_constrained` (bool) | The link moved the operating point *worse* than nominal. This is the design working: prediction carries more, the magnitude rises and stays bounded. Shown in the status bar as `LNK`. |
| `snapshot.cadence_floor_breached` (bool) | No schedule the controller may choose delivers a whole world inside the guaranteed window, or none arrived. This is not the design working, and it is the one condition adaptation may not hide. Shown as `nP <round trip> slow!`. |
| `snapshot.manifests_sent` (int) | Correction indexes this host published. |
| `snapshot.manifests_received` (int) | Indexes this receiver was sent, including the ones an older one was superseded by before it could be answered. |
| `snapshot.manifests_off_tick` (int) | Indexes compared against this receiver's present because no reading at the tick they describe was taken — neither held ahead of it nor promised by the index before. |
| `snapshot.manifest_bytes_sent` (int) | What those indexes cost, per peer served. On a converged link this is the whole of a correction. |
| `snapshot.manifest_bytes_received` (int) | The same figure from the receiving end. |
| `snapshot.corrections_hash_only` (int) | Corrections that carried no state at all: the roots agreed and the receiver proved it with a hash. This is the number the whole selective path exists to raise. |
| `snapshot.sections_compared` (int) | Section hashes examined while answering indexes. One per section per manifest, which is the cost of proving convergence. |
| `snapshot.pages_compared` (int) | Page hashes computed while descending into the sections that disagreed. Zero on a converged correction — the descent stops at the root. |
| `snapshot.hash_us` (int) | What indexing and comparing one capture cost *outside* the world lock. Read it beside `snapshot.capture_us`: if the second grows with the first, work has moved under the lock that should not have. |
| `snapshot.selective_bytes` (int) | What a non-keyframe correction currently costs on the wire, measured rather than assumed, and the figure the cadence controller and admission are priced from. |
| `snapshot.shards_requested` (int) | Pages a receiver put in play by sending its own hashes for them. |
| `snapshot.shards_sent` (int) | Pages actually returned, which is the subset that differed. |
| `snapshot.shards_received` (int) | Pages that arrived, including those in a repair later refused. |
| `snapshot.shards_refused` (int) | Pages in a repair that was not applied — a baseline this instance has moved past, a failed proof, a request this host could not build. Not an error: every one of them ends at a keyframe. |
| `snapshot.shards_applied` (int) | Pages spliced into a capture whose root then verified. |
| `snapshot.shard_bytes_sent` (int) | What the repairs cost, per peer served. |
| `snapshot.shard_bytes_received` (int) | The same from the receiving end, including refused repairs. |
| `snapshot.request_bytes` (int) | What the answers to indexes cost — an acknowledgement when the roots agreed, a page vector when they did not. |
| `snapshot.pages_repaired` (int) | Pages a verified repair replaced. |
| `snapshot.entities_repaired` (int) | Distinct entities behind them, in the component-store sections. |
| `snapshot.cells_repaired` (int) | Indexed cells the repairs carried, across every section. |
| `snapshot.proof_failures` (int) | Repairs whose rows did not reproduce their declared page hash, or whose result did not reproduce the root the repair declared. Nothing was written in either case. |
| `snapshot.baseline_refusals` (int) | Indexes or repairs describing a run, session or baseline this instance is not holding. |
| `snapshot.keyframe_fallbacks` (int) | Times the exchange gave up and a whole world was sent or asked for: a retention miss, a failed proof, a repair wider than the capture it was repairing toward, or a floor the receiver could not meet. |
| `snapshot.relay_retained` (int) | Authoritative records this instance is currently holding for a neighbour to ask about. A relay may answer only from these: an index enters the ring only once the capture under it is provably the authority's. |
| `snapshot.relay_served` (int) | Repairs this instance answered for a participant behind it, from that retention rather than from a world it authored. |
| `snapshot.relay_unserved` (int) | Requests it had to turn down, because it does not hold the tick the request names. The receiver degrades to the next whole authoritative world rather than waiting. |
| `snapshot.relay_bytes_sent` (int) | What those relayed answers cost, priced against the relaying participant's own link and never the authority's. |
| `snapshot.relay_bytes_received` (int) | The same figure from the receiving end. |
| `snapshot.replay_suffix_records` (int) | Crossings this instance is currently retaining for replay. |
| `snapshot.replay_records` (int) | Crossings re-applied in a projection, cumulative. Each one is an action this participant took that the capture did not contain. |
| `snapshot.replay_overflow` (int) | Retained crossings dropped by the tick, count or byte bound. |
| `snapshot.replay_skipped` (int) | Corrections that installed the authority alone because the suffix was incomplete. A partial replay is a guess, so there is no partial answer. |
