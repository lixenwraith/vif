// SnapshotChunkHeader precedes each frame of a capture in transit:
// [Tick:8][Index:4][Count:4][Total:4].
//
// A capture is the one message in this protocol whose size is a function of the
// world rather than of the format, so it is the one that has to be split: the frame
// header's length field is 16 bits and a storm's world does not fit in it. The
// chunk header names the whole transfer rather than just this piece — the tick it
// describes, which piece this is, how many there are, and how many bytes the
// reassembled body must come to — so a receiver can size its buffer once, reject a
// transfer that changes its mind mid-stream, and say which of the two it was.

// the wire, after the codec has compressed them. The largest world the engine
// holds — MaxMapCells walled, which is more than any scenario builds — measures
// 1.1 MiB here, so this keeps four times that as headroom for a world that grows.
//
// The defence is snapshotReserve below: a receiver allocates for the bytes that
// have arrived rather than for the bytes a sender says are coming, so the memory
// one peer can make a receiver hold is bounded by what that peer actually sends.
const MaxSnapshotBytes = 4 << 20

// MaxSnapshotPlainBytes bounds the body a capture expands to, which is a separate
// quantity from the one above: captures of a walled map compress better than 20:1,
// so a transfer well inside the wire ceiling still expands past it. That worst case
// measures 24.3 MiB, and this is the next power of two.
//
// It is the decompression bound, so it is stated as a ratio rather than a size: a
// peer may still send only MaxSnapshotBytes, and this is how far a receiver will
// let those bytes expand. Eight to one is what the codec achieves on a real world;
// flate's own worst case is 1032 to one.
