// Live message types are the ones a session actually exchanges. The reserved codes

	// MsgSessionRoute is the one frame a dialer sends before it reads: the name of
	// the session it was given. It exists so one address can carry several — a
	// front door reads it to place the connection, and the session it lands on
	// refuses a name that is not its own, which is what turns a stale link into a
	// refusal rather than a seat in a stranger's match. It is a routing key and not
	// a credential; the port is unauthenticated by decision.
	MsgSessionRoute MessageType = 0x05 // Live: the session name a dialer is holding

	// MsgLinkProbe and MsgLinkEcho are the round trip. Nothing else in this
	// protocol makes one — every other measurement is one-directional — so the
	// cadence had nothing but a constant to be chosen from until these existed.
	//
	// They are answered inside the transport, before the frame reaches a tick, so
	// what they measure is the wire rather than this instance's scheduling. An
	// echo carries back the probe's own bytes untouched, the bytes the far end has
	// received on the link, and the opaque LinkReport the far end's world last
	// published — which is the only game state that ever travels on them.

	MsgLinkEcho  MessageType = 0x15 // Live: one probe answered, with the peer's report

	// MsgScenarioRequest and MsgScenarioBody carry the session's scenario to a
	// joiner whose own roots do not hold it. The request names the digest the offer
	// announced; the answer is the deflated canonical form, chunked like a capture
	// because it is the other message whose size is a function of its content.
	//
	// They sit inside the join handshake, between the offer and the reply, so a
	// participant is running the session's scenario before it reports an identity
	// the coordinator would refuse it on. At most one request fits there by
	// construction: what follows the answer has to be the reply.
	MsgScenarioRequest MessageType = 0x16 // Live: a joiner asking for the session's scenario
	MsgScenarioBody    MessageType = 0x17 // Live: one chunk of the deflated scenario

	// MsgSessionRestart is the authority saying this session is rebuilding on
	// another scenario. It carries nothing: every participant already knows the
	// address it came in on, and the offer it is given when it redials names what
	// is being played. A scenario change restarts the run on both sides, so there
	// is no state to hand over — only the news that the door is about to close and
	// reopen.
	MsgSessionRestart MessageType = 0x18 // Live: the authority is rebuilding the session

	// MsgStateSnapshot carries one chunk of an authoritative shared-world capture
	// (D-19). It is the only message whose total size is a function of the world
	// rather than of the format, so it is the only one that is split; see
	// snapshot.go for the chunk header.
	MsgStateSnapshot MessageType = 0x26 // Live: one chunk of a shared-world capture

	// MsgStateCorrection carries one chunk of a periodic authoritative correction:
	// either a whole capture or a delta against the last one the host sent whole.
	// It is the same chunking as MsgStateSnapshot and a different message because
	// it arrives at a different moment — a capture is part of a handshake, on a
	// stream nothing else owns yet, and a correction arrives mid-session on a port
	// that is also carrying epochs, syncs and digests.
	MsgStateCorrection MessageType = 0x27 // Live: one chunk of an authoritative correction

	// The selective-correction exchange. A manifest is a compact index over
	// the same capture a correction would carry; a request is a receiver's answer to
	// one, naming the pages it could not reproduce; a shard set is the repair. All
	// three are separate message kinds rather than shapes of MsgStateCorrection
	// because they travel in different directions and are handled at different
	// moments — a manifest is broadcast on the cadence, a request is unicast back to
	// the authority, and a repair is unicast to the peer that asked.
	//
	// None of the three is chunked: each is bounded to one transport frame by
	// construction (see parameter.SnapshotShardBytesMax), and a repair too wide for
	// one frame is not a repair — the host answers it with a keyframe, which is
	// chunked, self-sufficient and already part of the protocol.

	// MsgStateUnserved is the answer a retention holder gives when it cannot
	// produce the pages a request names: it has dropped the manifest, or its own
	// world never agreed with the authority's at that tick. It exists because the
	// alternative answers are both wrong — silence costs the receiver a cadence
	// waiting for a repair that is not coming, and a body from a different
	// baseline is the mixed-baseline assembly the supersession rules exist to make
	// unreachable.

	// Succession, in the order it runs. A report is the news that the authority is
	// gone, flooded so a participant two links away learns of a loss only its
	// neighbour observed; a handoff is the record that lets a receiver adopt a term
	// it has never seen. Two kinds rather than one because a receiver acts on each
	// at a different moment, and because only the second is a membership change.
	// There is no vote: the successor is a function of the roster (see authority.go),
	// so 0x2D is retired rather than reused.

	MsgAuthorityHandoff MessageType = 0x2E // Live: the record a successor authors under

	// MsgPeerList is the reachability map: where each participant listens, so a
	// survivor can dial the successor a handoff names. It rides the authority's
	// term and is refused below the term the receiver holds, like every other
	// authoritative artifact. It carries addresses only — the confirmed set a
	// succession reads is frozen for the term and travels in the offer and the
	// handoff record instead. See reach.go.
	MsgPeerList MessageType = 0x20 // Live: the authority's confirmed address map
