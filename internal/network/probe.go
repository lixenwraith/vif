// Package network: the round trip.
//
// Nothing in this protocol used to make one. Every measurement a session had was
// one-directional — what this instance sent, and how far behind the newest tick
// it had *heard about* it stood — so there was no way to say how long a link
// actually took, how much its timing varied, or how much of what was sent had
// arrived. A cadence chosen from a constant was the only cadence available.
//
// The probe is that missing measurement, and where it lives is the design.
// It lives entirely in the transport: a probe is emitted by the port, answered
// by the receiving port before the frame ever reaches a tick, and folded into a
// per-peer estimate the port owns. No game state is read to answer one and no
// tick has to run for one to complete, which is both why the number is a wire
// round trip rather than a scheduling artifact and why network timing cannot
// leak into the simulation through it: the world's only contribution is an
// opaque LinkReport it publishes when it feels like it, and the only thing it
// gets back is an estimate it may schedule transport from.
