// Package std provides the standard action and guard library for fsm.Machine.
//
// Registration is split by coupling. Actions and guards operating only on
// machine state — variables, regions, timing, payload inspection — are always
// available. Those needing embedder cooperation are driven through Host.
//
// Host fields are optional. A nil field leaves its actions registered but inert
// and its guards reporting false, so a config referencing them still loads and
// validates. A zero Host therefore yields a pure machine, which is what
// non-game embedders (editors, tools, tests) want.
