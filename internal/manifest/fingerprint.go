// Fingerprint identifies the simulation this build assembles.
//
// Two participants in one session run the same code over the same seed and expect
// the same world. What decides that world is not the binary — a debug build and a
// stripped one simulate identically — but the manifest: which components exist,
// which systems are constructed, in which order, in which domain, and which of them
// carry state a capture has to move. Change any of those and the two runs are
// different games that will agree for a while and then not.
//
// So this hashes exactly that set, and deliberately not renderers or a system's
// local-only implementation capability: presentation and audio availability decide
// nothing about the simulation, and including either would refuse a compatible session.
//
// It is an identity, not a version. It says two builds differ; it cannot say which
// is newer, and nothing should try to order two of them.
