// Telemetry is what a capture, a correction and the selective exchange cost the
// instance that ran them. It is per-instance and excluded from the compared
// surface: a host publishes what a read cost it and a guest what an install cost
// it, and neither is a fact about the world they share.
type Telemetry struct {
	// Capture and install cost. ProjectUS and WriteUS split CommitUS, the live lock

	// staging world simulated so the live one never revisited them.
