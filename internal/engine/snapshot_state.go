// SharedStateSaver is implemented by a system that holds state outside any
// component store which can change a future shared outcome (D-19).
//
// The rule the interface exists to serve is stated in the multiplayer plan's
// hidden-state survey: a snapshot must carry everything that decides a future
// shared outcome, and much of that is not in a store — a maze generator's
// position, a learned route table, a genetic population, a derivation phase. The
// survey's conclusion was that no inventory of it exists. This is the inventory:
// a system either declares "state" in the manifest and implements this, or
// declares nothing and is asserted to hold nothing, and the boundary suite fails
// the pair that disagree. A system that quietly grows private state fails the
// build rather than a session, which is the same construction that made D-15's
// domain profiles mechanical rather than reviewed.
//
// What belongs here is what a component store cannot hold and install cannot
// re-derive. What does not: anything already in a shared entity's store, anything
// recomputed at install (the flow field, the spatial index, the passability grid),
// and any player-domain value at all — a snapshot describes the shared world and
// nothing else (D-1, D-6).
//
// Durations are written relative to the tick the capture names, never as absolute
// instants. Since the simulation clock became tick-derived (SimTime) an instant is
// already a function of the tick, so the two agree; writing the relative form
// keeps them agreeing if a capture is ever rebased onto a different tick.
type SharedStateSaver interface {
	// SaveShared serializes this system's future-affecting private state. The
	// encoding must be canonical: two instances holding equal state must produce
	// equal bytes, because a capture is compared as well as installed.
	SaveShared() ([]byte, error)

	// LoadShared installs what SaveShared produced. It is called on a staging
	// world before the swap, so a returned error rejects the whole snapshot rather
	// than leaving a live world half-installed.
	LoadShared(data []byte) error
}

// SharedStateChecker is an optional second half of SharedStateSaver: a carrier
// that can refuse a record before anything is written.
//
// The staging pass answers "can this build load this capture", and for most
// carriers that is the whole question — the same bytes into the same code twice.
// It is not the whole question for a carrier whose acceptance depends on state the
// staging world does not have: a genetic registry's registered species set is
// entered by a level transition the staging world has never made, so it accepts
// what the live world would refuse, and the refusal then arrives *after* the store
// pass has already rewritten the world.
//
// A carrier in that position implements this. It is asked on the live instance, in
// the same dry run that checks a capture does not name a system this build lacks,
// and a refusal there stops the install before a single store is touched. It must
// not mutate anything: it is a question, and the answer has to still be true a
// moment later when LoadShared is called for real.
