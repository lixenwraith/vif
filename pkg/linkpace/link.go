// Package linkpace measures a link and decides how fast to publish over it.
//
// It is deliberately a leaf: the standard library and nothing else. What it
// describes — a round trip, a delivery rate, a cadence in ticks — is arithmetic
// over numbers a transport hands it, and none of it may reach the simulation.
// Keeping it outside `internal` is what makes that structural rather than
// remembered: this package cannot see a world, an event or a component, so a
// measurement cannot become a game decision by accident.
//
// The package has two halves and they answer different questions.
//
//   - [Link] answers *what the link is doing*: round-trip time, its variation,
//     the rate at which bytes are actually arriving, and — the part that is easy
//     to get wrong — whether that rate is the link's limit or merely what the
//     sender happened to offer. A delivery rate measured while the sender is
//     idle says nothing about capacity, and a controller that treats it as
//     capacity will throttle a link that was never busy.
//
//   - [Controller] answers *what to do about it*: a correction cadence and a
//     keyframe interval, chosen inside declared bounds, never crossing the
//     convergence floor, and moved one step at a time so a single noisy sample
//     cannot swing the operating point.
//
// The floor is the load-bearing idea. Everything else here is a preference that
// may be traded away under pressure; the floor is the promise that a receiver
// gets a whole authoritative world within a bounded number of ticks no matter
// how the adaptation goes. A link that cannot carry that promise is not adapted
// to — it is refused at admission, or reported as an unrecoverable operating
// condition if it is already in the session. Silently publishing slower than the
// floor would leave a participant diverging with nothing to say about it, which
// is the one outcome the whole design exists to avoid.
