# TODO

Where the library may grow. Each item states what remains and the smallest thing
that would close it. Delete an item when it lands; this file is not a changelog.
Source files do not carry TODO comments.

Priorities: P1 is wanted next, P2 is convenient follow-up, and P3 is an idea.

Work that changes the library and stapes together is planned in [vif's
todo](https://github.com/lixenwraith/vif/blob/main/doc/todo.md#audio): tuning the
rip, closing its loop, and a meter for songs and patterns.

## The bank's instruments

### Bring the tonal voices nearer their recordings

- Priority: P2
- Affected files: `voice.go`, `bank/voices.toml`

The fit ([Audio §7](audio.md#7-music-sequencer)) took the piano and the bass to
Iowa's notes at pp, mf and ff by their level at 0.25 to 3 s, mel distance and
brightness. The piano's level by velocity stays the old law by the owner's
choice (pp 4 dB under mf, ff 2 dB over, where the recordings' spread is 14 and
12 dB): brightness carries the dynamic. What is left: the piano's lowest
octave still falls 4 to 6 dB faster than recorded by 3 s; its fundamental gains
the slow second string only from about C3 up (`bright`'s body rounds the first
paired partial), so f0's T60 steps from 5 s to 23 s across that semitone; the
bass's level error is 7 to 8 dB, against Iowa runs whose notes differ by as much;
and the pad and the lead are measured against main only, by their energy above
4·f0 and how alike two notes are, never against an instrument.

### Bring the drum kit nearer its recordings

- Priority: P2
- Affected files: `bank/drums.toml`, `kit.go`, `rip.go`

The kit ([Audio §7](audio.md#7-music-sequencer)) was measured against CC0 MP3
previews and Iowa's hihat, at three velocities each. What is left: an open hihat,
which the MIDI drum map's 46 reads as the closed one; a kick recorded several
times at one pressure, to set its strokes' spread (the Sonor set has one take a
pressure); and the analysis's bass and melody under the natural kit (stapes'
`bench 12 4` clean 0.15 to 0.03 and 0.17 to 0.11, augmented 0.04 to 0.08 and
0.13 to 0.13), a kick ringing at 52 Hz read as bass, which a model trained on
the new corpus is to be benched against.
