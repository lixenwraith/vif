# transformer

Inference for small transformer models over sequences of frames, in Go: float32,
the standard library alone, no cgo, on every platform Go builds for. A model
reads T frames of features and writes T output vectors, each its named output
heads laid end to end. The module runs models and does not train them: a model
comes from any trainer that writes its weight file ([doc/format.md](doc/format.md)).

---

## Package layout

- `transformer`, standard library only, is the whole module:
  - `config.go`: the shape (`Config`, `Head`, `Conv`, `Tower`) and its checks;
  - `transformer.go`: the layers, `Model`, `NewRandom` and `Forward`;
  - `weights.go`: the weight file, `Save` and `Load`.
- [doc/format.md](doc/format.md): the weight file's contract, enough for a
  trainer in any language to write one.
- [doc/todo.md](doc/todo.md): where the module may grow, and the seam each change
  would use.
- [doc/agent-notes.md](doc/agent-notes.md): the float32 check against a trainer,
  and what earlier work learned.

## Core types

```go
type Config struct {
    Inputs  int     // features in a frame
    Convs   []Conv  // convolutions before the input layer, none for a frame as it comes
    Dim     int     // the width
    Heads   int     // attention heads; Dim is a multiple of them
    Layers  int     // blocks of the one stack, when there are no Towers
    FFN     int     // the feed-forward's width
    Window  int     // frames attended on either side
    Towers  []Tower // stacks over the shared input layer, none for one stack of Layers
    Outputs []Head  // the output vector's named slices, in order
}

type Conv struct{ Out, Time, Freq, Pool int } // channels out, an odd kernel of frames by features, a max-pool over features
type Tower struct{ Layers, Outputs int }      // its blocks, and how many of the next heads it computes
type Head struct {
    Name string
    Size int
}
```

```go
func Load(r io.Reader) (*Model, error)                  // a weight file, checked whole
func NewRandom(cfg Config, seed uint64) (*Model, error) // small random weights, for tests and a trainer's shape check

func (m *Model) Forward(frames [][]float32) [][]float32 // one output vector per frame
func (m *Model) Slice(out []float32, head string) []float32
func (m *Model) Save(w io.Writer) error
func (m *Model) Config() Config
func (m *Model) Parameters() int
```

## The model

- **Convolutions**, optional, over the frames as an image, frames by features:
  each a kernel centred on a frame and a feature, the edges zero, a GELU, then a
  max-pool over the features.
- **An input layer**, linear, from a frame's features to the width.
- **Blocks**, pre-norm: multi-head attention over a window of frames on either
  side, then an exact-GELU feed-forward, each added back to its input.
  Attention carries ALiBi biases, a slope per head on the frame distance, in
  place of position embeddings, so a model runs over a sequence of any length.
- **Stacks**: one of `Layers` blocks computing every head, or towers, each a
  stack of its own over the shared input layer computing the next run of heads.
  Each stack ends in a norm and an output layer.
- **Heads**: the scores are raw; the caller applies its own activation.

[doc/format.md](doc/format.md) states the computation exactly, for a trainer to
match.

## The weight file

One file is one model: the magic `VIFT`, the format's version, the `Config`,
every tensor by name with its dims and float32 data, little-endian, and an
FNV-1a 64 checksum over all of it. `Load` checks the checksum, the version, the
shape and each tensor's name and dims, and refuses a file that disagrees in any
of them. A change to the bytes is a new version, and `Load` keeps reading the
versions trained files carry.

---

## Worked example

A random model saved and loaded again, run over a sequence, with one head read
per frame. A trained model is the same from `Load` on.

```go
package main

import (
    "bytes"
    "fmt"
    "math"

    "github.com/lixenwraith/transformer"
)

func main() {
    cfg := transformer.Config{
        Inputs: 16, Dim: 32, Heads: 4, Layers: 2, FFN: 64, Window: 8,
        Outputs: []transformer.Head{{Name: "events", Size: 3}, {Name: "level", Size: 1}},
    }
    m, err := transformer.NewRandom(cfg, 1)
    if err != nil {
        panic(err)
    }
    var file bytes.Buffer
    if err := m.Save(&file); err != nil {
        panic(err)
    }
    m, err = transformer.Load(&file)
    if err != nil {
        panic(err)
    }

    frames := make([][]float32, 100)
    for t := range frames {
        frames[t] = make([]float32, cfg.Inputs)
        for i := range frames[t] {
            frames[t][i] = float32(math.Sin(float64(t + i)))
        }
    }
    out := m.Forward(frames)
    for t := 0; t < len(out); t += 25 {
        fmt.Printf("frame %d: level %.3f, events %.3f\n", t, m.Slice(out[t], "level")[0], m.Slice(out[t], "events"))
    }
    fmt.Println(m.Parameters(), "weights")
}
```

## Invariants

- `Save` then `Load` gives a model of the same `Config` whose outputs are
  bit-identical to the saved one's (`TestWeightFileRoundTrips`).
- `Forward` is deterministic: one model and one sequence give bit-identical
  outputs on one platform and instruction set.
- A model never changes after `Load` or `NewRandom`. `Forward` writes no model
  state and allocates its buffers per call, so any number of goroutines may run
  one model at once; one call runs on one goroutine.
- `Forward` returns one vector per frame, the heads end to end as `Outputs`
  lists them, and nil for no frames. `Slice` returns a head's part of a vector,
  sharing its memory, and nil for a head the model has not.

## Gotchas

- The file decides the shape. A caller that needs particular inputs or heads
  checks `m.Config()` after `Load`.
- Every frame must hold exactly `Inputs` features. `Forward` does not check: a
  longer frame spills into the next one's place ([todo](doc/todo.md)).
- Outputs agree across platforms only to float32 rounding: arm64, and amd64 at
  `GOAMD64=v3`, fuse multiplies and adds, so their bits differ from amd64 v1 and
  386, which agree with each other.
- `Load` panics, rather than returning an error, on a header whose shape is too
  large to allocate ([todo](doc/todo.md)). Load files from trainers you trust.
- `Layers` is ignored when `Towers` are given, and `Heads` counts attention
  heads, not the output heads `Outputs` names.
- `Forward` allocates about 8 MB a call over 512 frames at width 256; a hot loop
  over short sequences pays for it each time.
