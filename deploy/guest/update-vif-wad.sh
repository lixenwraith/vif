# Replace the node's scenario volume with the checkout's wad/, atomically.

#   ./deploy/guest/update-vif-wad.sh              # the current worktree's wad/
#   ./deploy/guest/update-vif-wad.sh /path/to/wad # an explicit tree
#
# Unlike update-vif-image.sh this does **not** require an idle fleet, and that is
# the point. The swap is a rename: a running match keeps the directory inode its
# pod already mounted, and the next pod mounts the new one. Nothing reloads, and
# nothing has to.
#
# It installs the categories the fleet serves — scenario/ and image/ — and not the
# rest of wad/: a corpus is read on each player's own machine, never the host's.
#
# What it refuses: a tree that is not laid out like wad/, and a tree the fleet
# cannot load. Every scenario is validated by -check against the same mount layout
# a session gets, so one that would have failed an init container fails here first.
